,Divorce,"If you're reading this, chances are you're consumed with a lot of emotions right now.  You're not sure which end is up, why this is happening, or when it will end.  We're sorry that you're going through this, but we're glad that you are here.  /r/divorce is dedicated to helping those suffering through divorce with general advice, internet hugs, and just the solace and comfort that comes from talking to people who have walked the road that you're on.

We encourage you to talk about your situation.  The first step to healing is getting it all out in the open.  **A word of caution**:  If you feel your situation may be a difficult legal battle, or you are worried that it might become one, avoid sharing very specific details that may allow someone else reading your posts to figure out who you are.  There have been divorce cases where social media posts were brought into the courtroom.  

Here are some general guidelines to help you:

Please Do:

* Tell us how old you are, how long you were married, how many kids, if you own a house, etc.

* Tell us if you're using a mediator, collaborative divorce process, attorneys, or trying to DIY/Pro Se.  Please note, most people in this sub (and pretty much all the mods) are going to urge you not to go Pro Se, especially if children are involved.

* The basic reasons for the divorce.  Infidelity, physical/sexual/emotional abuse, addiction, irreconcilable differences, etc.  This is where details are important, but careful consideration of how much you reveal can be important.  ""Infidelity with a co-worker"" is fine.  ""STBX is traveling to Vegas and hooking up with co-workers at the ABC Pharmaceutical Sales Convention this weekend"" is not a good idea.

* Tell us where you are emotionally, as best you can.  This is an important step in the healing process.

* Tell us what you'd like us to do to help.  We can't offer specific legal advice, although we can let you know what to expect from the legal system, and we do have a handful of attorneys who are kind enough to offer their opinions from time to time.  But this sub is no substitute for a competent family law attorney.

* Rant or vent if you need to get it out of your system.  We've all been there before, we know it hurts.

* Realize that the family court system is not meant to be a place to seek justice, revenge, or moral victory for you.  Family courts exist to legally dissolve a marriage in the most efficient and fair manner possible, and to look out for the best interests of the children.  Your hurts, anger, bitterness, sense of betrayal, whatever, have no place in the courts and are irrelevant to the consideration of your child's best interests.

* Remember that you can no longer dictate/control/demand any sort of behavior out of your STBX.  They are free to spend their/your money in any manner they see fit; live with, sleep with, date with, cavort with, hold hands with, write the great American novel with whomever they see fit.  They can make whatever parenting decision they choose on their time.  We have a saying in /r/divorce: There is no law against being a bad parent.  There is also no law against being a bad ex-spouse.

Please **Don't**:

* Bash your STBX.  It is okay to be angry and hurt.  You should be.  But calling them names, tearing them down, and generally dragging them through the mud does not help you in any meaningful way.  We want you to tell the truth (""STBX has a drinking problem."") without badmouthing (""that [censored] waste of a [censored] who do they think they are [censored] drinking all day and spending all of our [censored] money).  We're not going to ban you, remove your posts, or chastise you for violating this suggestion.  But we may remind you that it isn't helping you with your recovery.

* Assume that custody will go for/against you because of your gender.  ""The courts are biased against fathers"" is pretty much a myth in the US today.  The courts are definitely biased against fathers who try to go to court without a lawyer.  Especially if the mother has an attorney.  Overall, however, most courts in most states are very open to 50/50 physical and legal custody if the circumstances allow it.  If you insist on posting a ""I know I won't get/will get custody because *my* state is gender biased"" thread, be prepared to have this notion challenged.  

* Take legal advice from your STBX or their attorney.  Once an attorney is involved, *they represent you or your STBX.  Not both of you.*  Do not fall into the trap of letting your STBX convince you to ""let my attorney handle it for both of us.""

* Make it a gender thing.  Men cheat.  Women cheat.  Both sexes choose to cheat at roughly the same rate, depending on what studies you want to point to.  Making generalized ""why do all men cheat?"" or ""why can't women be trusted?"" statements are not well received and will usually result in the post being removed.  Your STBX may have cheated, but one person does not a data point make.^TM 

* Use this sub as a place to further your own agenda.  If you have a burning desire to publish your misogyny or misandry manifestos, there are plenty of repositories of hate elsewhere on the internet.  This sub is not one of them.  We have one mod in particular who will relish in mocking your posts as he removes them.  Consider yourselves duly warned.

* Attack others.  We have a very diverse viewpoint in this sub.  We have Christians, Atheists, Agnostics, hippies, yuppies, hipsters, old farts, gentle curmudgeons, sarcastic barwenches, webcam girls, attorneys, gypsys, accountants, soldiers, sailors, airmen, police officers, peaceful resistors, lost souls...get the picture yet?  We're all different, but for one reason or another, we all belong to the fellowship of suffering that is divorce.  For that reason alone, we all respect one another's advice, opinions, and perspectives.  You do not have to agree with someone, but you do have to respect them.  All of the mods are very quick to support this.  This sub exists to aid in the healing of all members of this fellowship.  Not just the ones that adhere to your particular view of it.

We're sorry you're here.  But we hope we can help during the time you choose to remain part of our fellowship.

I initially thought 'whatever, that's her choice to make, we're not together anymore so it's not like I get a say.'

It was always an easy marriage we hardly ever had arguments.   she is a Very kind and Compassionate person. once kids came it made it harder to focus on the marriage and just devote all time to the kids.   about 3 years ago she said let's go to counseling.  we did and it helped for a bit. both work demanding jobs.. we kind of trailed off from counseling as work and kids took all the time.  she asked me a few months ago to go back to counseling.  i knew things had gotten off again between us since the last year or so i happily went.  unfortunately this time it to let me know  our marriage was over and that we had grown apart and the emotion connection between us is gone.

Like most husbands.  i spend the first week trying to figure out how i could fix it.  but i also remembered the old saying by  the time a man figures out there is a problem in his marriage and tries to fix it. it's already to late.  the wife spent the previous year trying to fix it and i didn't see it.  :(

i realize that once one of the partners in the marriage is done you can't try to fix it. and it usually would make things worse to try.  so i accepted the marriage was over.  we are working now on how to be the best co-parents. and she is so nice to me it breaks my heart but i realize this is what must happen.

it's heartbreaking.  she and the kids leave in a few weeks.  they are only going about 15min away and we are looking at 50/50 co parenting with as much together time between all 4 of us as needed.   that's just it.  we are great roomates . we get along fine.  just different levels of emotion connection between us .

,Divorce,"I posted previously about being deeply depressed about my husband wanting a divorce and a lot of people were helpful. I deleted the post out of shame.

A lot of people were saying he was so quick to turn cold and ditch me because there was someone else. I didn’t believe it and defended him.

GUESS WHAT you guys were right!

He obviously tried to turn it around on me. He talks about everyone at his work and I have never heard of her. He said she asked him why he looked upset lately and he said he told her because “he has nobody”. 

Yo, you’ve got a lot of people there and friends. Quit making excuses. There had to be emotional cheating before because there is noway someone would open up like that.

OH and she sent him a text saying “my husband is guessing something. I didn’t put my ring on today. He thinks I found somebody else... 😏like you .” Lololol All of his thinking and going out was with HER and not friends.

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people were saying he was so quick to turn cold and ditch me because there was someone else. I didn’t believe it and defended him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GUESS WHAT you guys were right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He obviously tried to turn it around on me. He talks about everyone at his work and I have never heard of her. He said she asked him why he looked upset lately and he said he told her because “he has nobody”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yo, you’ve got a lot of people there and friends. Quit making excuses. There had to be emotional cheating before because there is noway someone would open up like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OH and she sent him a text saying “my husband is guessing something. I didn’t put my ring on today. He thinks I found somebody else... 😏like you .” Lololol All of his thinking and going out was with HER and not friends.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are my epiphanies:

\-She will never give me the satisfaction I've been seeking.  It has to come from within.  She cannot and will not and has no desire to engage with me emotionally.  
\-There is no way for the two people in the marriage to say goodbye to it together.  There is no shared post mortem.  Each grieves separately and differently and for different durations.  
\-If it weren't for the kids we'd have no contact at all, or I would have been making contact with my vomited emotions, but she'd have had not reason to listen and would have blocked me.  Simply bc we have kids and thus communication channels does not give me to right to dump on her-My STBXW's coldness and stunning clarity all the way through about the fact that she was done and this was not a test was helpful. It was brutal and hard, but ultimately better than wishy washy false hope  
\-This was once the person I was closest to in the world. We brought two humans into the world and raised a dog, and professed our life long love to one other. And none of that means a goddamned thing now. We owe each other nothing more than coparenting now.  
\-I have the power to choose how I feel.  For 13 months, even as I've been working on me, I've kind of wallowed in sadness and tethered my feelings to things I felt I needed from here.  These were never going to come.  
\-The only way to get any closure is by surrendering to the reality--the divorce is happening, even if I didn't want it to--and to accept.  Surrender is simply making peace.  It is not a form of weakness.  It's giving up on the PAST in order to not waste the present.  It is letting go in a healthy way  
\-She has a boyfriend. I'd guess they fuck often in the bedroom that she and I shared for 12 years, and where we raised our kids and where my beloved dog slept. They take romantic trips and he now helps her around her house doing the things I used to do. She sucks his cock.  She likely loves him, and I'm sure he's a decent guy and he may love her.  He eats her out and gives her orgasms that likely inspire to profess to his prowess. They deserve to be happy.  And so I do, and I will find a great person, when the time is right.  Her relationship will not be perfect because they never are. It may last for the next 40 years or it may end in 6 months (and that won't matter). Accepting it and dealing with it as reality is better than sticking my hand in the sand and romanticizing him as the second coming and this is the single greatest romance of all time. It's two flawed humans, just as my marriage was, and just as my next relationship will be--only hopefully I'll take the lessons I'm learning now into that relationship, and be more aware of the flaws  
\-My kids will be fine and I cannot control some aspects of this because that is the nature of divorce (3 weeks ago my STBXW introduced her BF to them kids and it made me wonder about how people work this out; the reality is this is not something one can control; you cannot legislate your exes love affairs and relationships.

,Divorce,"When I married my wife 18 years ago, we had such a beautiful marriage. I really felt I was in a fairy tale. Within the first eight years of our marriage, we had two beautiful little princesses, how proud of a dad I am of my two girls, and what a great mother and role model she was. The future seemed bright and promising.

Fast forward 8 years, MIL is in the last stages of cancer and was invited into our home to live her final days. The death of my MIL was very traumatizing for my wife, no matter what counseling, psychologist, meds we tried, mentally, the damage was done. The only relief she found was in alcohol and as the weeks progressed after her mother’s death, she developed into an alcoholic. 

For the last 10 years, I have fought for my wife’s sobriety every day. I was always there to pick her up, clean her up, make sure she was ok trying to be the best husband I could along with playing both roles as a parent for my two girls. I stuck by her side amongst this including a few suicide attempts by her and the on going mental torture to myself and my children. Ive had to bear witness this beautiful person deteriorate into a high functioning alcoholic. This person was supposed to be my rock, my partner, a role model to my girls and chooses to drink her “medicine” and become angry at the world instead. 

I filed two months ago and since then, she has left. Our girls aren’t little anymore and they won’t stay silent. She had a choice to stay if she quit alcohol (me paying for full rehab) but her choice was to walk away from us and everything. 

Regardless of all this, it’s amazing to me how I still miss her, how I still love her, how I still worry about her wellbeing and how broken hearted I am to have allowed her to go. Now I know this had to happen, but now amongst the feelings of loneliness, failure, and regret, I’m also filled with the guilt of being responsible for any abuse my kids went through, how could I have kept this going for so long, I can tell you a man who loves his family will try and do everything he can for the best of everyone, unfortunately, we lost the battle to alcohol and one of our team members is now gone. 

I can share the worst part for me is how ones body reacts to traumatic events like this. Even though my brain says “you’re ok, work on yourself, focus on the girls, one day at a time” my body reacts physically with deep and shallow non stop heartbeats, similar to after a big meal, eye twitching, lack of hunger, amongst other items. My last meal was on Saturday where i nibbled a bit on chicken, that’s it. 

I look forward to the day where I can look back on all of this, but I sure wish there was a fast forward button.  We’ve talked a few times since she’s left.

Own a house and recently made a career change in the last three years (huge personal leap).  I have a very active lifestyle.  More fulfilled and making a lot more money.

We have slowly grown apart over the last several years.  Even after we first got married.   I was very insecure in my mid 20s and had a career crisis.  She very much wanted kids and a house.  I wasn't really ready, but went along and didn't back down from being a dad.  But I made her pregnancy very unenjoyable and it was totally my fault.  I caused lots of damage here.  Started therapy and she showed little interest in going.

From there, we never really had date nights (two date nights since my daughter was born nine years ago), vacations, and very little emotional or physical intimacy.  I am fundamentally a very affectionate man.  My wife was upset with my unhappiness and attitude, but bore it in order to keep things stable and intact.  We had my son and moved into a house about five years ago.  Things continued to decline.   We have slept in separate rooms since (or each of us with one child) and the disconnect continues.  I tried really hard to get her to love me (lots of tears and quasi begging), but to no avail.  I made plenty of mistakes on the way.  Eventually asked for an open arrangement so I could date on the side if she wasn't going to try to work on things.  She said it was fine as long as she didn't know about it.   We haven't had sex for almost two years.

I found a great therapist and got a new job (she thought it was too big a risk, did not support it).   In the last two years, I've allowed myself to just be okay with grieving and being sad and lonely.  I used to beat myself up for being sad.  I also stopped trying to work on things.  Emotionally burned out and exhausted by trying. She continued to coast.

I have always been on the cliff of divorce, but finally took the jump a few months ago.  Started planning and thinking more intently about the process.  One part of the push over the edge was caused by meeting someone who simply just made me realize I can do better for myself.   I can stop living in this unhappy, dysfunctional marriage and happiness might be actually possible.

Breaking this to my wife obviously has been generally crazy.  She thinks I'm destroying her life and the kid's life.  Very traditional mindset.  Recently, she's been trying to be super wife and do all the right things.  But she only really wants to stay married to preserve what she sees is best for the kids.  To her benefit, she's started therapy (I'm still going on my own, she wants me to go to couples therapy but I have no interest) and is getting on anxiety medication.  In fits of rage, she's also accused me of being an alcoholic and asked one night if I would ever hurt her or the kids (which is INSANE).  The latest development is that she's turned my sister against me.

I just want a new life.  A fresh start.  My own place.  Have my children see their father happy.  I will live in a cardboard box for the first year if I have to.  I can't do this every day indefinitely.  She's going to fight it.  I have talked to several lawyers.  I am just thinking of the right time to file.

Emotionally, I am managing.  I started to develop a more supportive network (hopefully some support here too) at the end of the summer because I knew I would need it.  I figured she might turn some people against me.

I feel I've had some pretty good legal advice so far, but I would appreciate any other feedback.  She can refinance and keep the house.  I just want my own place around the block, enough money to survive at first, and be able to see my kids as much as possible.  She can have physical custody.

,Divorce,"Like most stories, mine is a long one. I don't know where to begin. But this post in particular is about feelings of anger and frustration about my husband's behavior that I still deal with. 

I don't mean about the causes of the separation. I know I will be angry about that for a long time. 

I mean about the way he continues to communicate with me. We have a one year old daughter and a dog. I asked him if he will give the dog his medicine. No response.

I ask when he will come over to pick up our daughter. I have to ask multiple times over the course of days to get a response. 

Any time I ask something that he doesn't want to answer or doesn't think is important, he simply doesn't respond. Whether it's in person or by text.

The other day, she was crying and I smiled at her and he says, ""no, don't smile at her"". Not worth fighting over but I am so fucking tired of this man trying to control me. 

I hate how angry this makes me. I know I can't change him. We have been to 3 different marriage counselors. Two have refused to see him again. One said he gave up.

,Divorce,"So, a little backstory first. My wife and I have struggled off and on for the past 6 years of marriage. We have consistently done our best to make it work, but we often end up repeating the same arguments and getting in fights about the same things. We both need help with anger, patience, and communication to name a few things. It's gotten so bad before that we have brought up divorce, but have never proceeded, especially now that we have two young kiddos.

One of the biggest things that has caused tension between us (but certainly not the root cause of our problems to be clear) has been her family, especially her mom (MIL). Her mom is divorced and remarried, and if I could describe her in one word it would be alpha-female. She thinks she can control everything and is very pushy, tense, and controlling. What has bothered me the most is something that I noticed starting four years ago, when our son was born. She pushed me to the side while my wife was laboring and had to be the one to comfort her. She gave my son his first bath along with my wife because she apparently had experience. She told me how to arrange my home and fought me on it the whole way. 

Every major life event- birthdays, Christmas, car buying, my wife and I fighting, other holidays, she has to be in control. She tells everyone what we're going to do, when, where, who's riding with who, everything. It was just my son's birthday, where my son hurt his hand on a new toy, and as I was comforting him, she comes up to him, tells him that he needs to stop crying and tell her what happened so she could help. Fed up, I grabbed my son, said ""thank you, name, I've got this"" and walked away. She seems to think she is his parent and constantly undermines me and takes advantage of not having to discipline him. 

My wife simply says that she is like this to everyone and that I'm jealous, an not to take offense. And any time I've brought it up before I'm either being an ass, being ungrateful for her help, or whatever. 

I'm truly at the end of the line here. I feel like we're going in circles and my wife cares more about her mom than she does me. I feel as if she will defend her mom against me any day and that we just aren't a team. I've decided to give my wife an ultimatum.

I'd like for her and the kids to stay here, put the past behind us and seek counseling, giving everything we have at keeping our marriage. However, I'd like for her to stay away and avoid contact from her family for four months, namely her mom, but the sister and step dad have done their share of being asses to me and toxic to be around. (This is now five months since she hasn't given me an answer, I admit that was out of emotion because I can't believe she's actually unsure of what to do)

The second option is to leave and go live with her mom in the second half of their house. We will divorce. It's a nice home with plenty of room, and if she loves her mom more than me, it shouldn't be a problem, right?

Of course she thinks I'm crazy, controlling, and she swears that she loves me more. But I told her she clearly doesn't if four months away from family is worse than a lifetime divorced from me.

,Divorce,"...nonetheless frustrating and my reality.  My wife and I, both 34, have been married for about six months now.  No kids and neither of us had previously been married.  I really want the marriage to work, but we're seemingly at each other's throats a lot more frequently than we're on the same page.  We have very little in common which is okay, but when you're not head over heels about the other person (which neither of us are), it makes it very difficult to spend quality time together.  Everything kind of went south about a month after I proposed to her.  It was by no means a surprise proposal (she was very insistent upon getting engaged), but didn't disclose to me the fact that she was 15k in credit card debt until after the fact.  Fortunately, I do pretty well and was thus able to pay off her bills, but I've found it hard to trust her ever since then.  I don't know if divorce should be contemplated so early in the marriage, but I think we're both happier when we're not around one another, so the end seems inevitable -- it's just a matter of one of us getting the ball rolling.

,Divorce,"Okay, a little background. Me and my Ex had been together for 7-8 years on and off a couple times. This man has always been a drunk and it has broken us up. I’m not sure if he’d technically be a narcissist, but I know I’ve been emotionally abused for SURE. I’m a shell of who I used to be. We’ve always had a toxic relationship, and he was always accusing me of cheating. 


We have a 3 year old daughter.
His drinking has always been bad but my younger self didn’t see the red flags until it was way too late. It got to the point where once, for example, I was on my way to pick him up and he still drove home drunk and passed out immediately after. This was a usual thing. 
So 6 months ago I found out he cheated on me and I moved out because he didn’t want to get counseling or cut back on his drinking. Ok fine. We’ve had almost 50/50 with our daughter even though she feels more at home with me, I feel bullied by my ex to always give him extra time with her. New girl who he cheated on me w lives at his house and his lived there since pretty much right after we broke up. My daughter is the one that told me this and I could tell she was uncomfortable because it was only a few weeks after we had split up. She was confused and acting out. (Obviously) 


Since we’ve broken up, somehow I’ve become the bad guy, and he’s been nothing but rude to me. Has done things like, when he knows I’m on my way to drop my daughter off, he leaves the house and I’m late for work. 
He’ll call me when she’s not behaving and blame me and have me come pick her up. 

Anyways... I had a consult with a lawyer today for full legal and physical custody (I have always dealt w school, bills, medical insurance). My idea was him having visitation every other weekend. 
My argument is that my ex drives drunk/passes out often from drinking, has an unstable living situation (5 people in a one bedroom), and his verbal abuse to me and my daughter. I have multiple screenshots of my ex saying “sorry I was drunk” or bullying me and spiraling into a drunken whatever you’d call it. 
The lawyer told me that the fact that i waited so long to file ( a couple months), will make the courts question is my complaints are valid. And that since my ex hasn’t had any recent trouble w the law (DUI) it will be hard to prove he is unstable. She completely shot down most things I said, Including how he bullies and verbally abuses me. I told her how he doesn’t want to pay for medical or school, and she disregarded that. She also stated that as long as my daughter has her own bed, the court will see that as acceptable. Even though there are constantly people drinking and smoking weed around her, and barely even has a “room”. More like a closed off section of the house. 


She told me they won’t do a house check either so whatever my ex says in his interview pretty much is.
also told me the court doesn’t care who cheated, who moved out, and all that. Which I totally get. But I guess where I’m going w this is, if they are looking out for the best interest of the child, wouldn’t they consider everything? I kinda feel like this particular lawyer wanted an easy case instead of this one, since apparently I have no real evidence. 


And for the record, I waited this long because I didn’t want to be a bitter asshole mom and i wanted my daughter to see her dad. I also always feel guilty, I think that’s his manipulation creeping in the back of my head always, but yeah. 
I feel a bit let down, but have not given up. 
Am I crazy for feeling this way?",t2_81mwoex,False,,0,False,First consultation with a lawyer... am I crazy?,[],r/Divorce,False,1,,0,True,t3_dluuim,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Custody/Kids,False,1,,,1571810876.0,,[],[],{},,True,,1571838373.0,text,1,,text,self.Divorce,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, a little background. Me and my Ex had been together for 7-8 years on and off a couple times. This man has always been a drunk and it has broken us up. I’m not sure if he’d technically be a narcissist, but I know I’ve been emotionally abused for SURE. I’m a shell of who I used to be. We’ve always had a toxic relationship, and he was always accusing me of cheating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a 3 year old daughter.
His drinking has always been bad but my younger self didn’t see the red flags until it was way too late. It got to the point where once, for example, I was on my way to pick him up and he still drove home drunk and passed out immediately after. This was a usual thing. 
So 6 months ago I found out he cheated on me and I moved out because he didn’t want to get counseling or cut back on his drinking. Ok fine. We’ve had almost 50/50 with our daughter even though she feels more at home with me, I feel bullied by my ex to always give him extra time with her. New girl who he cheated on me w lives at his house and his lived there since pretty much right after we broke up. My daughter is the one that told me this and I could tell she was uncomfortable because it was only a few weeks after we had split up. She was confused and acting out. (Obviously) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’ve broken up, somehow I’ve become the bad guy, and he’s been nothing but rude to me. Has done things like, when he knows I’m on my way to drop my daughter off, he leaves the house and I’m late for work. 
He’ll call me when she’s not behaving and blame me and have me come pick her up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways... I had a consult with a lawyer today for full legal and physical custody (I have always dealt w school, bills, medical insurance). My idea was him having visitation every other weekend. 
My argument is that my ex drives drunk/passes out often from drinking, has an unstable living situation (5 people in a one bedroom), and his verbal abuse to me and my daughter. I have multiple screenshots of my ex saying “sorry I was drunk” or bullying me and spiraling into a drunken whatever you’d call it.

,Divorce,"My mom announced to me this weekend that her and my dad could be getting a divorce. I moved out about a year ago and live with my bf and am only now at a point in my life where my parents and I have a friendship type of relationship where they are open with me and look to me for advice and friendship and not just as a child. 

This news has completely broken me. Growing up my family was the idealistic family where the two parents love each other and have a big home where everyone is welcome and my friends with divorced parents would often tell me they wish their parents were like mine. 

My mom came to me crying this weekend telling me they’ve been arguing non stop, and that she’s willing to do anything to change and reconcile their marriage. She found out he’s been talking to a woman at work who is also married and texting her and sneaking around to see her and telling her he loves her. My dad is an alcoholic and always has been and he is completely closed off in communicating, simply drinking and being the fun guy and letting things go without ever bringing up issues. He’s brought up issues from 20 years ago and on saying he’s never been happy and that she is too controlling and never lets loose or has fun (which is kind of true). 


My dad feels as though she’s manipulated him into being with her all these years. Partially this is because I am the oldest child and my brother and sister are still young 10 and 13 respectively. He is an amazing dad always worked 6 days a week to pay off the house early, cooked, cleaned, at every sports game, life of the party, funny outgoing, supportive etc.. From his perspective he has never been happy/ felt loved but coming from an abusive home growing up felt like he needed to be married to ensure he was in his kids life, he didn’t want weekend visitation etc (I was born the day they were married and a year and a half into their relationship) and dealt with years of arguing and controlling behavior and bottling up issues and resentment now feeling that’s there’s no way to restore it and find love when there was never a spark. He claims the lady is just a friend and is willing to go to counseling but only because he is scared getting a divorce will keep him from being in his kids life. 

He told me every year older they get there’s less reasons to stay and as he’s getting older and looking back on his life he sees that there was never a spark and that he probably has less good years left to enjoy without my mom then the length of time he’s been with her. 

It breaks my heart to see both of them so hurt. My mom wants to fight for the relationship and is changing her ways, cooking, cleaning, trying to be more affectionate etc. My dad genuinely feels there’s no connection and her changing is more of her manipulative ways trying to trick him into being happy with her. He also feels he is stuck and will have to spend the rest of his “good years” trapped in a loveless relationship for the sake of his kids that he loves more than anything. 

It honestly just makes me feel so disappointed and sad and hurt. I don’t even know what these feelings are but it hurts when you have this dream of what a perfect love is between two people you thought were happy only to find out they’ve been sacrificing their happiness to show you something that was fake. 

Any advice or kind words from anyone who has gone through this before would be helpful.

,Divorce,"Hello there you fine divorce people on Reddit, 

This is not only my first post on Reddit, this is also the first group I joined. Why? Take a wild guess…I’m divorcing. 

I’m in my early thirties, father to a beautiful toddler, and I’m divorcing she-who-I-thought-was-the-love-of-my-life. 

I’m joining this group so that I can talk to folks going through the same thing that I’m going through…not that I haven’t found good advice in bars or on a going-nowhere date from a dating app. 

Just to give you a little more back story on my situation. My ex and I separated almost two years ago after our son turned one. We had been married for four years and before that, we were together for almost four years. 

These last two years have been filled with a lot of pain, regrets, sadness, some lonely, but many lessons learned. Not that there was only pain and sadness…there have been so many happy moments and not to be too blunt…a lot of cumming.

When my wife decided to move out, she moved a block away from my house, so that we could both be around our child, who we share custody…not that there has been anything in writing until very recently. That was working great even though in the beginning it was really hard because I was still fighting to try to keep our marriage and family unit but my ex wanted the complete opposite. During that time, all the friends we thought we had together…all took their sides, in our case many of the friends I thought we shared, ended up just being her friends. 

She had started dating the minute she decided that the relationship was over, which at the time we were still living in the same roof. She would either sneak out or say that she was staying with one of those friends I mentioned but instead she would go to the dude she started seeing. 

I instead started working on myself around that time, started working out more because I had put on some weight in our marriage, not that I was crazy out of shape but not in the shape I was when I met he…but shortly after she moved out I too started “fucking around”…I say fucking around because at that time I was not looking for anything serious just looking to “fuck” her out of my system…which I did.

Those few months at the beginning of the separation, I had lost about 30 pounds, ran a marathon, and became somewhat of a gym-rat…while still making sure that my son was getting all the love and care in the world.   

From dating app to friends of friends to meeting random people at bar…the age-of-fucking had begun. At that time, I met a bunch of really cool ladies to some of the craziest people I have ever met.  Out of the cool ladies, I found so many that knew exactly at what stage of my life I was, many who had been there before themselves…I found their advice and guidance to be helpful. 

During that time, things with my ex didn’t get any easier. We also awkwardly ran into each other a few times on dates, which sucked because we were living in the same neighborhood but what sucked more was that those were nights when she said she was watching our son…which bothered me not only because she lied but because I have never paid anyone to watch our son the nights I have. 

She ended up leaving my neighborhood, which brought about other smaller problems, like her wanting to put my son in a daycare near her new house, which I was very against and fought from him to stay in the daycare he had been since he was only a few months old…which I make sure to wake up around 5 am on the days he is not with me so that he can attend. 

I know that I mentioned the age-of-fucking before but that age then brought about the new age- of-love…a few months ago I met the most amazing woman, one which I am currently building a relationship with. Seriously, every day I fall more and more in love with my new girlfriend. Not going to say that she’s the one

With all of that out of the way, my ex filed for divorce a month or so ago, which she has been arming herself for that war for more than a year now consulting with her boss’s divorce lawyer…from printed out texts to folders of files which I still don’t know the content….instead of arming myself, I have been more focused on my boy and his needs…but since filling, her life has been falling apart and with none of those friends I mentioned earlier or any meaningful relationship to support, I’ve had to step up to help her. 

Instead of being vengeful, I’ve tried to be as helpful as I possibly could, at times overextending myself but not because I still love her or anything like that, but because she is my son’s mom and in the end anything that can hurt her will hurt him…not that me being his father ever stopped her from being petty and vengeful with me….I bring this up because I’m a little concerned that entering this divorce…I am not approaching it in the same way she is. I have no intention of destroying her life, I have no intention of making her life a living hell, my only intent is that we get 50/50 custody of our boy and that we get a chance to see him every day...which might not be realistic because they way our family court system is set up, which is to destroy life and drive people into bankruptcy….but things have been going very well between us as of late…but I don’t want to rely on that. 

Just wondering, what the mentality on my part should be going into this divorce? Any thoughts? Advice?!

,Divorce,"My ex husband and I rode together to our children's parent teacher conference today. We have been getting along really well for about a month, and idiot that I am I ask him if he would like to spend some time together to see if anything is still there.

Long story short, he has always struggled with alcohol and became a full blown alcoholic as soon as our 4 year old twins were born. The stress of twins was a strain enough on our marriage, but add in his excessive drinking and his lying about it and the wedge between us became catastrophic.

I thought things were better about 2 years ago and we built our dream house together. Right before we move into it his family problems blew up so bad that his mother was arrested (everyone says their mother in law is awful but I assure you there are no words to describe her). This pushed him further off the deep end than I ever imagined.

After a year of him spiraling out of control then stopping and begging me not to leave him, he went to a 28 day in patient rehab. A lot happened in that year including me having to clean up a grown man for crapping himself in our bed at 11am because he was so drunk. To say I was angry and hurt from all the lies claiming he wasn't drinking is an understatement.

His whole time in there he swears I'm everything to him that he will do anything to keep me. I'm overwhelmed caring for our twins, trying to visit and support him and trying to process everything. 

I started going to a therapist and she helped me start sorting out my feelings. I was terrified for him to come straight home and he had mentioned a sober living house so I told him I really wanted him to go there and we would try dating because I wanted to get past this all more than anything.

Once he moved into the sober living house it was like he did a 180 with me. We went to a couples therapist twice and she basically said he was too reluctant to try. we went on two dates if you can even call them dates and the only time he tried to kiss me was once while I was sobing in the parking lot after a failed marriage counseling session. I of course stopped him because I was so confused and upset.

Fast forward 2 months of us fighting constantly when he visited the kids and he decides a divorce is our only option. I reluctantly filed and he basically gave me everything in a very amicable, uncontested divorce. Because we have kids it was a 90 day waiting period to be finalized and I spent that whole time heartbroken and asking him if we could please put it on hold until he had more sobriety under his belt. He said no and seemed emotionless while I've cried more than I ever imagined possible.

The divorce was finalised Sept 10th and it was like something switched in him again and I thought he was even flirting with me lately. He has been sober 8 months, working his aa program, and seeing a therapist. So today I decided to bring up us. All of our problems were about his drinking and he is working on himself harder than ever.

He absolutely crushed me when he said he has no romantic feelings about me anymore and feels zero attraction to me. He says that I abandoned him and that he will never get over that. He told me too much has happened to ever be in a relationship with me again. 

When we decided to divorce he said it was to protect me and the kids because he didn't think he could stay sober, not because he didn't love me or want to be with me. He told me a month ago that he knows he wants sobriety and that he has to be sober to live. I thought ok if that was why we divorced then maybe we can reopen that door. 

I stood by him through so much and it crushes me to hear our children cry when he leaves. I just cannot comprehend how he was begging me not to leave him in March, that he loves me more than anything, and now in October he has no feelings for me.

She came along and was everything I thought I wanted.  I separated/divorced my partner and began living with her soon thereafter.

The relationship was good overall, she and I finished the same program in college things were going well.

I sponsored her after a couple of years living together. Then her sister arrived from abroad, and we took her in (she did, and is paying us $600/month)

Later on when we began making a bit more money we bought a townhouse, and sister moved in with us.

Fast forward, she upgraded her degree and completed a professional program and was overall more successful in her career.

In the mean time, my son, who lives overseas, is now old enough to come visit me and has done so in 2018 and 2019 summer.

I noticed that something was way off in August while my boy was still here, I brushed it off as to not get distracted and not to deprive him of any attention.

She was in the final stages of completion of her certificate, and I did everything to give her space, peace, and quiet. This is a demanding certificate so this was necessary. So it came as a complete surprise that she decided to go on a business trip to London for 1 week (I say decided because she had the possibility to decide when to go). It later turned out the the trip was with her male (single?) boss, and that further she had booked Air BnB for them both for a ""pleasure"" day. They stayed in the same place, according to her with multiple bedrooms.

When she came back I was assuming the worst, and this is when the fights began. I felt that she had betrayed my trust, not because of the trip itself, but because of timing, and the scarcity of details around other activities that took place beside work.

I later looked into her phone thinking that a genuine affair was happening, I read through the Whatsapp text with the boss, and found that although it was quite familiar, nothing indicated adultery.

I did find another string of texts between her and another man. Where meetings were taking place either when she was supposed to be studying with group members, while I was at work, and one meeting took place when I was at D&amp;B with my son for his birthday.

I confronted her on it, she downplayed it by saying that he is only a friend, nothing more.

This last Saturday, I discovered another text about a dinner that was yet again to take place while I was at work.

Full disclosure, we had several fights, ones where I called her nasty names, which is why she is saying she accepted to meet with him again.

We’ve been married 9 years. We got married entirely too quickly...literally 4 months after we met. Had a baby in the first year. Then was pregnant with multiples.

However I was the one doing all things baby and home related alone. They are extremely developmentally delayed...and require a lot of attention. Without going into much detail...he neglects them. I’ve been the single parent since day 1 with them. Then, I recently found out he’s abusing prescription medication. I’ve been saving pictures/texts/video/audio for a year now of evidence to back myself up. I finally told him about a month ago that we need to call it quits. I’m done. He flat out told me that 1-he will not sign any divorce papers or attend any court appearances 2-he will not leave our house 3-he will go to jail before he pays child support. Real class act.

There’s a whole slew of raw emotions. Over the course of our relationship (10 years, married 4) Ive lost touch with many friends as tends to happen. We don’t have kids, but our friends have kids or fell by the wayside of our “coupledom”.

,Divorce,"Hello, I'm F/48 and I've been separated from my husband (44) for a week now. I had to sign up for a new account because my kids are on Reddit a lot. 

I never wanted this, but I'm the one who initiated it. I don't know what I'm looking for exactly, but I'm ripped up inside and I need to get it out. 

My husband travels for work. We live on a little hobby farm and we have four kids, all over the age of 9. Several years ago he cheated on me. At the time we worked it out through marriage counseling and we stayed together. It was extremely difficult, and his gf at the time didn't want to give up on their relationship. She called me pathetic for taking him back. I get she was just trying to hurt me, but it stuck. I feel like I lost all of my self esteem when he cheated and I don't think I ever got it back. 

Things weren't all bad, but he has veered from cold to loving and back again, and I never knew where I stood. I had a few things I wanted to change after he cheated, but he basically ignored me. He ignores all types of conflict and situations. He's had a rough time with work many times because he avoids people if there is a problem. He just won't return calls for weeks or months, until he's forced to confront it. 

Over the years he spent more time away from the kids and I, even when he wasn't working, because he has hobbies he's really interested in. To me, they seem over the top. He can't just do them once in awhile, he has to do them every day. 

While he's been wandering/working/enjoying his hobbies I've been staying home with the kids, working from home and making decent money, keeping a stable home life for them. I've been mom and dad because I've felt so strongly I had to be.  I've had dreams I've let die because I knew if I asked he wouldn't take over whatever chores or take on extra child care so I could pursue what I'd like to. Whenever I asked him for help he'd get all pinched and grouchy while he would help me. I learned not to ask. I've become very resentful, so he's reacted like he's resentful of me. 

I thought I could fix everything by trying to find out why he was running away all the time. I have always tried to talk to him, be close to him, but he avoids all conversations about our relationship or he stonewalls me when I try to work things out. Things were becoming worse, and I asked him to go for marriage counseling. 

First he said sure, he would make the appointment. I waited two weeks, not asking or anything, and when it became clear nothing was going to happen I asked him. Now he didn't want to go. We went back and forth for months over it, both avoiding having the conversation, and I finally said he had to leave if he wasn't going to try to fix our problems because it was killing me to continue the way it was. He said fine, I'll leave. We split for 10 days, he came back, and it continued on like 'normal' for a few more months. Last week I said OK, I can't do this anymore. Nothing has changed, so if you won't go to counseling I'm going to go by myself. When I said that, all of a sudden he said he'd go. I was surprised, but I was hopeful. I had an appointment booked. He did leave again that day anyway, and said he was going to stay with a friend. 

Long story short; he stood me up for marriage counseling. That was a week ago. I honestly almost laugh about it, because it's just so awful. I waited outside, looking for his car, and he never came. I went in anyway. Thankfully I found a good counselor. 

He loves the kids. He's a good dad for certain things, but he doesn't seem to be emotionally connected to them. They come to me to talk or vent. I wish they could do that with him too, but I think they sense he's very shut off. He also reacts to emotions in ways I don't understand. He either gets mad or just stares at you blankly if you're crying or if the kids are crying.  It's weird. 

I've left early for the past few mornings so he can come make the kids breakfast and get them off to school. He never did that before, his plans/work always came first or he'd sleep in, but I told him he has to now. My teenage son actually said to me, ""Hey, this is OK. Now you don't have to be mom and dad anymore."" 

There's so much more. I could go on for hours, but at the end of the day I know it hasn't been great for years. So why am I so so sad?  I can't put my finger on what it is I feel. It's not lost, it's something else. I try to do normal things and I don't feel like it's that different because I have been alone a lot. I just feel horrible inside, very tired, and completely abandoned. I don't really have anyone to talk to but my counselor and that's once a week, so here I am.",t2_4urh5587,False,,0,False,"Newly separated, still in shock",[],r/Divorce,False,1,,0,False,t3_dlnuze,False,light,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Getting Started,False,2,,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1571804700.0,text,1,,text,self.Divorce,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;#39;m F/48 and I&amp;#39;ve been separated from my husband (44) for a week now.

He said fine, I&amp;#39;ll leave. We split for 10 days, he came back, and it continued on like &amp;#39;normal&amp;#39; for a few more months. Last week I said OK, I can&amp;#39;t do this anymore. Nothing has changed, so if you won&amp;#39;t go to counseling I&amp;#39;m going to go by myself. When I said that, all of a sudden he said he&amp;#39;d go. I was surprised, but I was hopeful. I had an appointment booked. He did leave again that day anyway, and said he was going to stay with a friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short; he stood me up for marriage counseling. That was a week ago. I honestly almost laugh about it, because it&amp;#39;s just so awful. I waited outside, looking for his car, and he never came. I went in anyway. Thankfully I found a good counselor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He loves the kids. He&amp;#39;s a good dad for certain things, but he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be emotionally connected to them. They come to me to talk or vent. I wish they could do that with him too, but I think they sense he&amp;#39;s very shut off. He also reacts to emotions in ways I don&amp;#39;t understand. He either gets mad or just stares at you blankly if you&amp;#39;re crying or if the kids are crying.  It&amp;#39;s weird. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve left early for the past few mornings so he can come make the kids breakfast and get them off to school. He never did that before, his plans/work always came first or he&amp;#39;d sleep in, but I told him he has to now. My teenage son actually said to me, &amp;quot;Hey, this is OK. Now you don&amp;#39;t have to be mom and dad anymore.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s so much more. I could go on for hours, but at the end of the day I know it hasn&amp;#39;t been great for years. So why am I so so sad?  I can&amp;#39;t put my finger on what it is I feel. It&amp;#39;s not lost, it&amp;#39;s something else. I try to do normal things and I don&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s that different because I have been alone a lot. I just feel horrible inside, very tired, and completely abandoned. I don&amp;#39;t really have anyone to talk to but my counselor and that&amp;#39;s once a week, so here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi Everyone,

Separated (36F) with husband (40M) of 9 years in 2016, divorced late 2017. We did everything we could to be the best co-parents to our 8YO. Family dinners, holidays together, alignment in raising our kiddo in 2 households. Christmas 2017 he decides to share with me that he's on dating apps not in a proper convo or as part of an existing convo...rather, as a throwaway comment christmas eve when he mentions that a work friend of mine swiped on him. Things were fresh and I was devastated. I got over it (they never dated). I asked him to be mindful about context and then wished him happiness. Fast forward to April 2018 - a month that was awful for me because he was a passive agressive dismissive person in social interactions. I didn't need deep emotional connection, but whenever I'd try to talk to him over dinner with our child present, he'd just whip out his phone and scroll social media. It felt like I was interacting with a teenager, just so disrespectful. Later that month he asks me if I want to buy a set of tickets to an escape room from him, things are okay with us. I declined, and he mentioned he couldn't make the event as he had our kid. I offered to babysit and even go with him, cause...I thought we would be ok. After a back and forth convo he decides to tell me they're for his GF of a couple of months. Well, not proud...but I lost my mind. I felt like I was being rejected all over again. Throughout this process I wasn't my best self. I took space and no contact and travelled. Came back and last fall was great for us, I thought we were becoming friends.

Starting this year (Jan 2019), he's been the same dismissive person and more. He mocks me, he is not present during family time which we wanted for our child (1hr dinner oncd a week), in the middle of me talking he'd pull out his phone or distract himself by starting a convo with our kid...every way to make me feel like I didn't matter. In addition to that, he picked fights. Bringing up things around the end of our marriage, situations that are obscure, accusing me of things that didn't happen, asking me if we could have saved the marriage, looking for lies. How did our relationship end? From my perspective: He became emotionally avoidant and dismissive through my post partum depression and a lot of trauma (family member died, another had severe mental illness)...I also didn't know how to ask for help so it's not all his fault...I sought the attention of other guys - emotional infidelity...I hit rock bottom...and then I asked for the divorce. We were both flawed humans. I own my fuck ups. So 2019 is the year of him ""being an asshole"" to me - something he admits in the same tone you would use to convey the day of the week (""It's tuesday"" ""I was an asshole to you""). He then, in an argument this summer chooses to drop on me that him bringing up the past where HE IS PICKING FIGHTS WITH ME, is unfair to the oh so ""kind"" (""geniunely kind"") woman he has been dating since FEB. What. The. Hell. I thought he and I had a comraderie where 1. Him dating someone wouldn't be used as a weapon in an argument (because isn't it good news) 2. He is hurting me, but feels sad and concerned about how it will impact a woman who until this point has not existed for me.

So my question is to anyone willing to weigh in. Why do people do this? If you are in a new relationship, should you not be happy? Why shit all over your ex? Especially when they are your co-parent and someone who geniunely is not out to fuck you?

Throughout this year, before I learned about new gf, there have also been some incidents that were odd, but now seem odder - 1. He will share with me that his family wonders why we are not together given that we are so amicable. While people ask me that too, I never share that with him because it's not a healthy convo. He did this in April/May, when he would have been dating someone. 2. He has twice walked around his house in his boxers, mid-changing outfits. While our kid gets a kick out of it and I didn't mind in the moment (because I laugh it off as go put on clothes, dude), knowing that he was dating someone makes me feel...smarmy. 3. He will tell me to get over the end of our marriage and that he doesn't want to talk about it, but every time he is angry with me, the biggest source of throwing situations in my face is our marriage...so he can talk about it, but I can't.

**TL:DR -** Why is an otherwise amicable ex suddenly an asshole to you when he's dating someone (when by all accounts, that person he is dating is a good person - I choose to believe the new gf is good because I want good people around my kid).

He then, in an argument this summer chooses to drop on me that him bringing up the past where HE IS PICKING FIGHTS WITH ME, is unfair to the oh so &amp;quot;kind&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;geniunely kind&amp;quot;) woman he has been dating since FEB. What. The. Hell. I thought he and I had a comraderie where 1. Him dating someone wouldn&amp;#39;t be used as a weapon in an argument (because isn&amp;#39;t it good news) 2. He is hurting me, but feels sad and concerned about how it will impact a woman who until this point has not existed for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is to anyone willing to weigh in. Why do people do this? If you are in a new relationship, should you not be happy? Why shit all over your ex? Especially when they are your co-parent and someone who geniunely is not out to fuck you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this year, before I learned about new gf, there have also been some incidents that were odd, but now seem odder - 1. He will share with me that his family wonders why we are not together given that we are so amicable. While people ask me that too, I never share that with him because it&amp;#39;s not a healthy convo. He did this in April/May, when he would have been dating someone. 2. He has twice walked around his house in his boxers, mid-changing outfits. While our kid gets a kick out of it and I didn&amp;#39;t mind in the moment (because I laugh it off as go put on clothes, dude), knowing that he was dating someone makes me feel...smarmy. 3. He will tell me to get over the end of our marriage and that he doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk about it, but every time he is angry with me, the biggest source of throwing situations in my face is our marriage...so he can talk about it, but I can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL:DR -&lt;/strong&gt; Why is an otherwise amicable ex suddenly an asshole to you when he&amp;#39;s dating someone (when by all accounts, that person he is dating is a good person - I choose to believe the new gf is good because I want good people around my kid).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Family time has been suspended for over a month now, forgot to mention that. Trying to limit contact as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Hello all. I'm going through some things and I apologize in advance for anything that isn't structured appropriately. I'll tell you about our progression as a couple and I would love some insight. I'll probably also post this on r/sexover30 as well.

I think we both think the other is very good looking and are genuinely physically attracted to one another. But because of life and work, we have sex usually once/week on the weekend. I wish we did it more, but I'm sure every man thinks that way. Maybe they don't, I don't know. I've tried talking to her about it and I feel like I'm pretty explicit. Like ""Hey, how do you think our sex life is?"" ""You know I'd be up for doing it more... if you wanted."" Nothing really changes.

I’ve been divorced since January of this year and met someone in March. We’ve been dating since and despite some drama and ups and downs, things are becoming more stable and we are now in a full relationship. 

He’s a great guy and on the weeks I’m not with my kids, he stays with me at my house. Which... is 5 min from my ex’s house. 

My kids are 5 and 3 and they were in my ex’s house for the first 8 months as we did the nesting routine (the kids stay in the house and the parents rotate weekly). I moved in to my house in September and now the kids are in a new routine of moving back and forth between my place and my ex’s. 

As I live so close to my ex’s and the kids’ school, me and my boyfriend feel it’s just a matter of time for them to accidentally see mommy with her “male friend”. My bf and I agree that he should be introduced to them sooner than later but I really don’t know what the best way would be to approach this.

Some background info, I'm 27, he's 28 and our girls are 2 and 4. We separated in March of this year. Our divorce is a week from this Thursday. We're legally still married. We've had an on-and-off amicable and even friendly relationship since he moved out.

He says she's not going anywhere and that he wants to share this part of his life with her. He does not want to wait any longer. They're *serious*. I asked him if he planned on marrying her. He said he doesn't know, he hasn't thought about it, and I asked him what the hell he's thinking trying to introduce someone to the girls that he doesn't even know is going to be in his life permanently.

I don't even know what to do at this point. We made an agreement and he is now going back on his word and breaking his promise. He is being extremely selfish and the only logic to his thinking is ""I want this and I want it NOW."" When I told him that it is recommended to wait at LEAST six months, he said ""I'm not doing that. That is WAY too long.""

I'm a child of divorced parents. I did not want to have a revolving wheel of women in and out of their lives. I told him that. He said he's held up that part of the bargain but that 3 months is too long.

,Divorce,"**Hi, my name is Catt.** I am 29 years old, and I will be thirty on the 24th of November. My STBX and I have been married for 6 years on Halloween. He is 27 as of October 18th. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure where to begin so here goes nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

We got together in the end of 2012, early 2013. By Mothers Day of that year, I found out I was pregnant and by Halloween I was married. It was weird to me that I had found this person after completely giving up on love. I had been a bit of partier, slept with a hand full of people but had never been the type to let that get me down or let other peoples thoughts effect my image of self. 

Our marriage was shortly blissful due to life situations. We were living with my mother and we had both found her the morning she had past. My mother past ten days before my daughter and my absolute love Anastasia was born on January 8th. I wouldn't say that the blame here is 100 % mine or his, and  to be 100 percent honest I could literally give a crap less whose fault was whose.  I began in-golfed with the challenges of new motherhood and the loss of my mother. I became rigid and cold. In April of 2014 I found pictures on his phone. And a dating app. I was kind of wondering if it was getting attention from someone else because he wasn't sharing with me anymore ( He also went out a night and never came home ) . He had bought a new phone, which I knew about and his old phone was in the dresser drawer I heard it vibrate. I looked inside because curiosity killed the Catt I seen a notification from [meetme.com](https://meetme.com), upon opening the app I seen an up to date picture and on his profile it read single. I was hurt, upon more digging I found out that he had receiving ( and exchanging cant get a confirm or deny on this )  pictures from a girl in a neighboring town. I was obviously infuriated and confronted him. I had asked to leave and he did. I should of been doing then but after just a few days I took him but and he continued. 

&amp;#x200B;

In June of that same year we had gotten notification that we were approved for an apartment in low income housing and I decided to give him a second chance. We became closer again. 

&amp;#x200B;

We moved in and everything was seemingly normal for the most part until around my birthday. When I discovered the pictures again when I felt the distance again.  I was 24 he was 21. I don't know why I did it again but I looked through his phone. I know this is complete disrespect to privacy  but  had a gut feeling. The feeling wasn't wrong. I found pictures of girls from social media. People who were our mutual friends. All clothed but wtf. This was messing with me. These girls were nothing like me. I am a average american woman size 13 and dark in appearance . These girls were blonde and beautiful and size zeros.  It was literally giving me trauma. I felt uncomfortable just going to Walmart with him, seeing beautiful thin women in the bikini ads. ( Is he looking at them?) I was loosing it. Even thou I am a heavier woman, I had never dealt with that kind of insecurity ever. Before I was married I was ( still am now again ) a attractive confident woman.  He was giving me a complex. I tried to hold it in, but it eventually come back and I confronted him. He told him that he had a compulsion issue. That he needed help. That he would seek therapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I gave him another chance. About another past and I found out that we were expecting another child in September of 2015 . We were joyous things were going good and even though we were struggling I believe that things were going to get better. I was working at a new restaurant and he was pumping gas at a service center but we were doing good. We were out of low income housing, we both had cars. Our daughter Anastasia was 2 1/2 and thriving. We were on the right track. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And then in March, of  2016 on a routine visit at at my obgyn for weight check my OB had was looking at my ultra sound, he suddenly looked over to be and asked me if I had been doing drugs. I wondered wtf he had been talking about I was a weed smoker which he knew about before pregnancy but I was not during. My self control is pretty high. He turned off the monitor and checked my cervix. Without any further words he said I had to go to the children's hospital. I was taken away in an ambulance,   my STBX followed in our car up to the city where the hospital was, approximately 30 miles away from our home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can remember the white lines on the high way, blinking as I watched them past in the window of the back of the ambulance. Disassociation.  I was strapped down, and the paramedic was my Nurse Aide teacher from years before at Job Corps. I knew in the bottom of my stomach. Once I arrived at the hospital rude emergency room nurses tossed me from little room to little room and I felt that was alone, but soon enough stbx arrived and he got there in time for my triage. 

&amp;#x200B;

After an array of questions, I was quipped with the question ""still smoking marijuana?"" Wtf I felt like I was in the movie ground hogs day and no matter what I said I couldn't get answers. I said very angrily ""No"" After listening to the key board click. ""Well you tested positive in September for Marijuana"" I rolled my eyes, oh yes wow I smoked weed before I knew I was pregnant my DOC was August 2-5th. I didn't find out until Sept 10th ish, and the drugged test was taken (without my consent) on maybe 26th. I explained to the nurse crying in my gurney. She nodded, and pursed her lips. ""Well move you up to the third floor. "" And off we went. A few hours later, I was up stairs. They told me to get rest for the night that the doctor would be in with me in the morning. Stbx stayed sleeping on the chair.  He was supportive and kind, reassuring me that all would be fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the morning, a gaggle of doctors filed in and told us that our daughter Juliette was ""incompatible with life"" A really dressed of way of saying our baby was going to die. I got sent home after they explained to us that we we had a genetic disorder ( poly cystic kidney disease) and that we had both carried it and that our first child Anastasia was unaffected explaining that was hard we didn't know.  I would come back in three times a week. and my best option was to make her comfortable. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing about me is I am a lion of a mother. I was in denial. She was born via c section and I told them to do everything that they could for her because I was not going to not do what I needed to do to give her a fair chance. They int-abated her,  and rolled her away and I passed out, after weeks of wondering of she had passed inside of me at any time she was here, she was moving she wasn't making noise but she was alive. I was out. 

Ceiling tiles, I woke to see them, instead of the normal baby in a bassinet next to me I had to go see her. STBX was there waiting for me I demanded upon going and stood and got into a wheel chair. Two hours after a C Section. I didnt care the drugs were working. I saw her in her little bed, with tubes and wires coming out of everywhere maybe 15 or 16, I held her little hand and she had it back. We were going to fight.

&amp;#x200B;

Well like most things, hope is blind and after ten days and plenty of poking and prodding we had exhausted all options. We were making her suffer and me and STBX had to remove her from life support. He was amazing, he held her as they removed her throat tubing. He was strong I was not strong to hold as she past. I knew in that moment, that I would always care about him. We had shared this, we had struggled and we were going to be okay.

&amp;#x200B;

So I thought. Time passed. Juliette was born April 18th, past April 28th. and now we were in November and I had bought us new iPhone 8s . I was pumped I had never used an iPhone STBX had one. He was showing me around his phone when his photos popped up again. Women again. I could believe it and on top of that they were centered on porno that were like ""just 18"" and some from where ever whole in the dark web that seemed to be maybe even underage late teen girls topless. I felt everything in my body clam up and I punched him straight in the face, called my friend, grabbed my daughter and left.  As I left the house I could hear him scream, and break thing inside of the house. I was shaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I left him, I broke up with him and slept with someone else (old friend, and drug abuser, great choices) . I knew it was wrong because the whole time I felt guilt but I needed to feel wanted, I needed to feel desired. Was I not beautiful could I only create death and dread inside of him. Mind you he was sweet kind, innocent type. He had lots of trauma like me including molestation I thought we understood each other. I couldn't anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

We were separated for seven months, and in that time he had made it back in my heart. I gave him another chance. (Stupid fucking self) and now here is where we are. I feel nothing, I don't even feel like I am attracted to him, and over the weekend  found myself drunk, putting my hand down someones pants. It was all good and fun but it made me realize that in order to get away from him I was going to hurt him. I'm sorry he may have hurt me 10000000 times, but I wasn't the one that hurt people while being ""together, committed"" so I was on the fence. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday morning he woke me up 'accusing' of masturbating instead of having sex with him because he found my panties 'wet' .And that was the last straw I didn't scream I didn't get angry I told him I was done and that I could fuck myself whenever I wanted to. And many other things. And here I am, on day two. We agreed that I deserve to be happy and that he had hurt me too much for me to feel in love with him.  I do love him. But not passionate love. It is gone and I will be 30 soon, I cant keep trying that I was done. So yeah, I was told I have to be separated for a year to file for divorce. 

&amp;#x200B;

Were civil I'm sure it wont stay like this. But he agreed to leaving. He will stay with his bother. But how do I go on, whats next, any advice on how to tell my five year old ? that's the only thing that really frustrates me. Thank you if you took the time to read this all. I already feel better getting that out. I hope to find friends here.

My STBX and I have been married for 6 years on Halloween. He is 27 as of October 18th. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure where to begin so here goes nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got together in the end of 2012, early 2013. By Mothers Day of that year, I found out I was pregnant and by Halloween I was married. It was weird to me that I had found this person after completely giving up on love. I had been a bit of partier, slept with a hand full of people but had never been the type to let that get me down or let other peoples thoughts effect my image of self. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our marriage was shortly blissful due to life situations. We were living with my mother and we had both found her the morning she had past. My mother past ten days before my daughter and my absolute love Anastasia was born on January 8th. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say that the blame here is 100 % mine or his, and  to be 100 percent honest I could literally give a crap less whose fault was whose.  I began in-golfed with the challenges of new motherhood and the loss of my mother. I became rigid and cold. In April of 2014 I found pictures on his phone. And a dating app. I was kind of wondering if it was getting attention from someone else because he wasn&amp;#39;t sharing with me anymore ( He also went out a night and never came home ) . He had bought a new phone, which I knew about and his old phone was in the dresser drawer I heard it vibrate. I looked inside because curiosity killed the Catt I seen a notification from &lt;a href=""https://meetme.com""&gt;meetme.com&lt;/a&gt;, upon opening the app I seen an up to date picture and on his profile it read single. I was hurt, upon more digging I found out that he had receiving ( and exchanging cant get a confirm or deny on this )  pictures from a girl in a neighboring town. I was obviously infuriated and confronted him. I had asked to leave and he did. I should of been doing then but after just a few days I took him but and he continued. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June of that same year we had gotten notification that we were approved for an apartment in low income housing and I decided to give him a second chance. We became closer again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved in and everything was seemingly normal for the most part until around my birthday. When I discovered the pictures again when I felt the distance again.  I was 24 he was 21. I don&amp;#39;t know why I did it again but I looked through his phone. I know this is complete disrespect to privacy  but  had a gut feeling. The feeling wasn&amp;#39;t wrong. I found pictures of girls from social media. People who were our mutual friends. All clothed but wtf. This was messing with me. These girls were nothing like me. I am a average american woman size 13 and dark in appearance . These girls were blonde and beautiful and size zeros.  It was literally giving me trauma. I felt uncomfortable just going to Walmart with him, seeing beautiful thin women in the bikini ads. ( Is he looking at them?) I was loosing it. Even thou I am a heavier woman, I had never dealt with that kind of insecurity ever. Before I was married I was ( still am now again ) a attractive confident woman.  He was giving me a complex. I tried to hold it in, but it eventually come back and I confronted him. He told him that he had a compulsion issue. That he needed help. That he would seek therapy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"So my wife and I are looking at getting divorced in the next couple of months and we have minor children.  We both agree that there is nothing to contest because we do not want lawyers getting involved draining us of our money.

There are a couple of specific questions I have concerning the filing  of the forms.  First, we've agreed that she should purchase her own house.  The house we've been living in is in my name only, on the deed and the remaining balance of the mortgage.  This property was owned by me **before** we got married.  Our thinking here is that it might be easier for her to secure a mortgage before the divorce since the divorce could negatively impact both of our credit records.  However I also don't want to claim any sort of ownership to her new house that she buys.  There's no real place to show this on the standard divorce forms though.  Should we take a different approach or do we just have to explain this to the judge?

Second question is relating to child support.  I have agreed that I would voluntarily pay my wife a certain amount of money every month for the next 10-15 years (don't know the exact term yet).  We both make about the same amount of money from our jobs, so what is the child support situation going to look like exactly?  Can she decide to waive it? We both agree that we want to be involved in the kids daily lives...literally every day handling school functions and picking up/dropping off.

I have complied with what she has wanted, moved out. Purchased a home to fit me and my children, but if she leaves the area..I will be left with crushing debt and no recourse.

Ex-Wife \[33/F\] and I \[32/M\] separated last year and the divorce was final at the end of 2018. We have two kids, she has primary custody. We manage OK when she's not upset about something. If she is angry about something she sends me tons of messages via text and calls me repeatedly. When this happens the messages are pretty harassing and not constructive. Additionally, my ex-wife has been meddling in my personal life ever since separation and continues even now. Long story, short: I discovered in late June that she contacted a woman I was dating some time February or March and said who knows what. I didn't know it at the time but this lead to her breaking up with me - it was shocking because her and I were doing great and felt like it came out of nowhere. I only found this out because my ex-wife contacted another girl I was dating in June and she told me. We subsequently broke up, she didn't want to be part of the drama. 

This was eye-opening to me. It made me realize she is never going to leave me alone so I've taken steps to make sure she can't find out if I'm dating someone. She was finding out who I was dating via social media even though she was blocked. I actually relaxed my privacy settings - I now have a public instagram and many of my facebook posts are public. I unblocked her. Instead I don't post any photos with my SO and the ex is totally in the dark. 

The actual reason for this post: incessant messages.

Part of the process of totally blocking her out of my life was to get a new phone with a new phone number that only I and people I trust know. The old number is still active but it just goes to VM now. She's figured out I have a new number (I figured at some point she would) and is now demanding that she has the new number to reach me at.... in case of emergency. which is bull shit. I've asked her to contact my mom in the event of something urgent and my mom knows how to get in touch with me. One of my sons has a cell phone so she's able to call and talk with the kids when she wants. She's freaking out because I won't give her my cell number. I only talk to her via e-mail. She's sent me emails like ""I don’t need to call your mother or email. Are you refusing to provide a number or do you don't have one?"" immediately followed by another email ""I will have to report this if you aren’t more clear. You are being very evasive and honestly it’s worrisome."" and then another email ""I’m getting concerned. What is going on"". All within 3 minutes. She's always threatening to 'report' something but never says to who exactly (more bs). I'm only replying when she has a valid question - like, where are the kids going to be. Anyway she's wigging out and I'm starting to get unsettled about her myself. I do not want to get the police involved because she's my kids' mom...

,Divorce,"Hi everyone, this is mostly an 'off my chest post.' I'm living in a foreign country for work, so I don't have many friends here, and certainly no family. 

My wife went away to work somewhere (more) exciting for a few months, and she came home yesterday and told me our marriage was over. She's had some mental health problems in the past, and she apparently met someone who could better support her through them. So a 9-year relationship, 2-year marriage is gone now. I feel like crap.

Two days ago she came home, I had the flowers, her favourite food, everything ready. She walked in the door and told me we were done. I was destroyed. Yesterday I would randomly break down, probably 3 or 4 times. Today I'm sure I have one or two of those breakdowns still ahead of me and one behind me. I'm talking to lawyers, but we are both foreigners to the country, so lawyers are looking into it before committing to the paperwork.

Right now it looks simple, she wants what's hers, and intends to leave me with what is mine, and so far there are no disagreements over what belongs to whom. We have no kids, and she doesn't want the cat. So the logistics seem sorted out enough (foreign country aside.) Despite all that, I can't stop thinking about her. Everything I do is something *we* would do. Anything I watch was something *we* would watch. Even the games I play, places I visit- those are games *we* would play, places *we* would visit. She was such a huge part of my life, and while I'm sure it's cliche, this whole mess really felt quite sudden. 

I tried to see if there was ground to stay together on, but she was very forward in admitting that while she was away she cheated on me, she offered the sex, and she didn't regret it...twice. Before those revelations, I was willing (hopeful even) to have her in the spare room, willing to try and work it out. Hell, I might have been able to work with the first one, maybe (probably not) the second thing on that list. But each one of those things hit harder than the last. I told her she needed to go (her mum is nearby), and we would sort everything out later. When she finally left the house that night, I was just a shell. I suppose it makes the 'wondering why or who or what' easy, but accepting the reality is far from it. She says she never cheated before, and since she was so forward with everything above, there is no reason not to believe her. I'm still young, 29, but that makes it feel worse- I've shared almost 1/3rd of my life with this girl. Halloween was always her favourite, Christmas tied or a close second. Both of those are around the corner, and for the first time in almost a decade, and really, as an adult, I'll be spending them without the girl I promised to spend my life with. 

Despite all that I keep checking facebook, checking texts, hoping for the message that tells me it was all a joke, or a mistake, or a dream. Despite all that I want her here. I miss her so much. I loved her so much. Also, add one to my breakdown tally up there.

,Divorce,"Why do things have to be this way when divorcing? Especially when I am not the spouse that wanted the divorce initially? She cheated and I’ve found out more than I knew. Even when she was pregnant with my now two year old baby girl. My five year old jumped on the couch while it was full of clothes, fell off and hurt her arm. I didn’t think it a big deal so inflated down in bed with her and she fell asleep. 

Around 3am this morning I heard her whimper a little so I checked her and she said it still hurt so I took her to the emergency room. The nurses and doctor checked her out and had xrays taken. Said she seems to be ok that it’s just sprained. They put a splint on her and said follow up with an orthopedic doctor in the morning. Ok no problem. 

Of course I let her mother know what was going on and she reacted as I expected. Than she asked to come over and see her and wanted to give her a hug. I said no. “ you can see her when it’s your days with them”. The same way she does me. I’m done doing her favors.

My five year old jumped on the couch while it was full of clothes, fell off and hurt her arm. I didn’t think it a big deal so inflated down in bed with her and she fell asleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 3am this morning I heard her whimper a little so I checked her and she said it still hurt so I took her to the emergency room. The nurses and doctor checked her out and had xrays taken. Said she seems to be ok that it’s just sprained. They put a splint on her and said follow up with an orthopedic doctor in the morning. Ok no problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I let her mother know what was going on and she reacted as I expected. Than she asked to come over and see her and wanted to give her a hug. I said no. “ you can see her when it’s your days with them”. The same way she does me. I’m done doing her favors.

I know I shouldn't have but I did. I was hurt and I wish she wouldn't have texted me. I should have been smarter and stronger but I wasn't.  She said ""Im not sure what this is about.""

Then I wrote *""You needed me to keep the kids so you could set up the tv etc. it’s fine. Loved having them and would have w out switching. But you were home. The stupid notice from Netflix confused me.""*

We went back and forth...I would not have said anything about this had she not asked me to switch nights, had not she not told me about new tv and/or had I not gotten the dumb netfllix sign on notice (they use my account).  Then she said *""I""m a little concerned you're still feeling this way""* which I took to me she cannot believe I still have emotions around the divorce and the loss of the marriage.  And from there I went into some emotional revelations.  Not pleading or begging.  Not even expressing love for her.  Just admitting that I was still processing things.

I wrote the following: *But yes I still have thoughts and feelings about losing my family and the end of the marriage. I will until I don’t. And it’s certainly providing impetus for growth and change. I know you are in a diff place.*

*I’m happy for u and in some ways you’re lucky. I think you dealt with the pain and sadness while in it. You’re further ahead. Not a race. We also process differently. I know you’re not lucky bc u also went through a lot. But you’re kind of in a good place. So am I. But in a diff way That’s all.  I don’t know that it matters.*

*You’re in a relationship now. I hope it’s all you want and making you happy. I can say that and wish it the best and want it to make u happy but at same time still have it cause me some emotion.*

so this is is sort of asking for advice (financial stuff toward the bottom) and sort of just venting.  i'm sorry in advance for the bitching, i'm just super stressed and don't really talk about it much, so when i let the dam open it kind of all floods out, especially behind reddit anonymity.  but panic is setting in.  i have absolutely no idea how i'm going to do this.

my (36F) soon to be ex husband and i have never been good with money.  both kind of impulsive and indulgent, not great at saving.  not poor enough to be good at being poor, occasionally struggled with bills but mostly managed because we made OK money and student loans are deferred until after you finish school.  he makes more than i do by about $20K ($60Kish to my $37Kish).  we got married in 7/17, bought a house, got a dog (german shepherd), i got pregnant... american dream, yeah?  well at 37 weeks pregnant he tells me he's not happy but 'we'll see after the baby is born', and when baby is 6 days old he tells me he's done and stops wearing his ring.  i'm... broken.  i loved him with everything i had, we were together for the better part of 8.5 years.  he said he was unhappy for a while, but he couldn't have fucking talked to me before we were married homeowners with a baby on the way?

baby is 5 months old now, we've been 'legally separated' since July 2.  we're still in the house together, living in separate rooms and on very different schedules.   emotionally it's a little easier now, and it's convenient for child care, but i don't think i can do this for much longer.  my feelings for him waffle between longing and disgust, and it rips holes right through me when i'm home with our child, in our house, and he's sleeping somewhere else, presumably with someone else.  so i need to get out.  BUT money stuff:

&amp;#x200B;

he wants nothing to do with the house or the dog or really any of the responsibilities we accumulated as a couple.  he leased a brand new truck and is planning on moving into an apartment.  i can neither afford nor maintain our current house, and don't want to live in it anyway.

i bought a new car when i found out i was pregnant that i am about $8K upside down on ($17K loan balance, $9K KBB value), and i don't think i can afford rent or a mortgage and still make my $385/mo car payment.

i have about $4K in hospital bills from prenatal care and birth that are about to roll over into collections, along with some other medical bills and credit card debt that keep me living paycheck to paycheck even with his support.

i'm on the mortgage of this house so it's hard to look for a new one, and he's still got 'things he wants to do before we sell it' that will probably never get done.

i can't rent an apartment with my dog (dangerous breed bullshit), and i love my dog and really REALLY don't want to give him up

i'm in school part time, one semester to go before i start the nursing program which is 2 years of mandatory full time classes which is going to be a bitch to do and still make enough money to live

&amp;#x200B;

my broad plan is to sell the car for a cheaper one, hopefully that i can somehow buy with cash, maybe get a debt consolidation loan to sort out some of my debt, and buy a cheap house.  possibly declare bankruptcy after i get the house ('cause i'll be able to keep it, right?)

i just don't know how the fuck i'm going to do it.  right now my credit's 'good', but i'm worried that it will drop soon as i have those bills that i can't pay up in the air.  i'm struggling to stay afloat while we're still living together, i have no idea how i will make a home for myself and my daughter once we're not.  i'm a grown ass nearly 40 year old woman and am just so lost.

&lt;p&gt;i can&amp;#39;t rent an apartment with my dog (dangerous breed bullshit), and i love my dog and really REALLY don&amp;#39;t want to give him up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m in school part time, one semester to go before i start the nursing program which is 2 years of mandatory full time classes which is going to be a bitch to do and still make enough money to live&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my broad plan is to sell the car for a cheaper one, hopefully that i can somehow buy with cash, maybe get a debt consolidation loan to sort out some of my debt, and buy a cheap house.  possibly declare bankruptcy after i get the house (&amp;#39;cause i&amp;#39;ll be able to keep it, right?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i just don&amp;#39;t know how the fuck i&amp;#39;m going to do it.  right now my credit&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;good&amp;#39;, but i&amp;#39;m worried that it will drop soon as i have those bills that i can&amp;#39;t pay up in the air.  i&amp;#39;m struggling to stay afloat while we&amp;#39;re still living together, i have no idea how i will make a home for myself and my daughter once we&amp;#39;re not.  i&amp;#39;m a grown ass nearly 40 year old woman and am just so lost.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thank you for listening, sorry again for complaining, any advice (emotional or financial) would be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

Obligatory throwaway details changed etc..

I'll say this upfront that I don't think I'm the good guy in this story and I'm sure I'll cop it for this but I'm just so lost and I need someone to tell me that I can make it through this.

I'll also say that this will be long and even if no one reads it it will be a good vent.

My now wife and I have been together for 7 years, married for just under 2. It's never been perfect and it's never felt right - for whatever reason I had the idiotic mindset that when certain things happened in our life (moved in, engaged, married, kids) that the bad parts would go away - that she would change.

We've had so many arguments that it's at the point now I don't even bother pretending to try anymore. We fight about the stupidest shit and I'm just made to feel like the worst human on a regular basis. If it's something I've done I'll be belittled and emotionally abused, if it's something she's done I'll be made out to be the bad guy that always tells her things are wrong - the guilt is overwhelming.

Regardless of whether we agree on an issue and promise to make changes she never follows through. We had a huge argument last weekend about a range of things inc lack of a sex life, how I feel she's never willing to make changes, other things which I'll get into.. and she promised to change and for what it's worth for the rest of the weekend that was true. Two days later she's back to her old ways taking stabs at me and just making me feel worthless and guilty all the time. 

I'm made to feel bad for going to see my friends for a few hours - despite spending all week with her because if she doesn't go then she feels they'll judge her. She doesn't want me going to gym because it will make her feel inferior. She doesn't like me having hobbies because it frustrates her that I have interests and she doesn't.

Here's the shit part.. we're expecting, at about the 7 month mark now.. and I want to leave.

I want to be the best father and person I can be, and I'm convinced now that I can't be that man in this relationship.

It's not about being scared about the child, it's not about her pregnancy hormones - this has been going on for years and all because I was too weak to do anything about it.

There's so many things to consider, the house, how the rest of the pregnancy is managed, child support in the years to come and her mental state - but I just need to get out and work on fixing myself.

Has anyone been through this or know anyone who has? I'm so lost.. and I need guidance.

Wife has treated me awfully for years and I was too weak to do anything about it. We're expecting a baby and I recently came to the realisation I don't want to be miserable all my life and need to leave to become the best father/person I can be.

,Divorce,"Like many people before me, I'm here to say you're going to be alright. It's been 8 months since she laid it on me, I'm 27m she's 26, no kiddos (my heart goes out to those with kids). She felt the need to go out and reach her highest potential without anything weighing her down (marriage, mortgage, 2 families). I was a burden.

I'm just gonna try and be as constructive as possible without making you read too much. Here's what worked/didn't work for me in order:

Cry. Grip the dagger that's still in you, because it's definitely there. This is YOUR pain that you MUST come to terms with and accept. This is the most pain you've ever endured, and you'll remember them both; the pain and your endurance. Today I think to myself ""the first cut is the deepest and I still made it through"".

Move out. Don't live in that soul-crushing, purgatory environment. The only things left there are the pieces of the future you expected to see, and you can't tape them back together. You can still speak with them or see them elsewhere, but you need sleep, and you won't sleep well there.

Keep a journal. Chances are you can't even hold onto a thought before another realization flattens you. By writing your thoughts down you can cement them before they get away, and you'll have a physical record of your mental health progression. Don't write with the 
Notion that you or someone will read it in the future. Just get it out

Imma wrap this up. If you want more, DM me.

Work your ass of at your job. As many hours as possible. 

Talk to your friends and family A LOT. Don't do it alone.

Go back to your roots. Stay in or visit your hometown. You have your own identity and you're fucking COOL.

TAKE IT DAY BY DAY - things will change like they always have. Relationships will form and older ones will grow.

If anyone can ralate, I hope you get through this okay. Its good to know we're not alone.


The hardest part of coping is my group of friends who have never been married,  engaged and have families, are worn out and the only advice and comfort they can offer is ""you will find someone better"". But its not about finding someone better. Its not about the ending of a romantic relationship, its about losing my family. I lost my family and i feel like im dying inside and the fact that the holidays are right around th corner only intensifies that pain. I have no one. No one to share with and trust. Im alone and abandoned. If i at least had some sort of a family it wouldnt be as painful because I'd still have a group of people to share with and  trust, come home to maybe, but now i have no one.

&lt;p&gt;I cant wait for better days. I just wish they would come sooner.... i&amp;#39;m worried about the holidays, i have no one to spend them with. I&amp;#39;m holding on day by day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad this thread is here. There are plenty of posts that give me hope and just enough encouragement to keep going. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone can ralate, I hope you get through this okay. Its good to know we&amp;#39;re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of coping is my group of friends who have never been married,  engaged and have families, are worn out and the only advice and comfort they can offer is &amp;quot;you will find someone better&amp;quot;. But its not about finding someone better. Its not about the ending of a romantic relationship, its about losing my family. I lost my family and i feel like im dying inside and the fact that the holidays are right around th corner only intensifies that pain. I have no one. No one to share with and trust. Im alone and abandoned. If i at least had some sort of a family it wouldnt be as painful because I&amp;#39;d still have a group of people to share with and  trust, come home to maybe, but now i have no one. I have to hold in because they dont get it and theyre tired of my crying, they dont understand how much i am hurting, how much bigger this is than a &amp;quot;break up&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess I&amp;#39;m asking for guidance on &amp;quot;what now?&amp;quot;. We&amp;#39;re both apparently eager to conclude things. We have no entanglements in the form of children, assets and liabilities. It should be easy to fill out whatever forms are required to dissolve our union but I don&amp;#39;t have a clue where to start. I&amp;#39;d prefer to avoid the expense of a lawyer if at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone point me in the right direction as to a starting point? I think both of us would be most grateful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"TL/DR at the bottom

So my husband and I have been together for 8 years but married for 5. We have no children. Before I moved around with him at the beginning of this year, he would work out of state as a welder for big plants (pay and per diem was big reasons why he worked away from home) and I have done jobs that barely paid above minimum wage. Before that, I lived in one state and he lived in another due to my work and caring for a disabled brother. 
I have found that my husband has cheated on me for the second time this year (that I know of). He has been on multiple dating websites and talking to multiple women. I have lots of proof of him sending inappropriate pictures and saying all kinds of things. And inb4, yeah I shouldn’t have gone back but I was stupid and thought that he would really change. I know now that he won’t change. A lesson that I will take with me for the rest of my life. 
I am about to get another job with a significant pay raise as well as awesome benefits so I am taking this as a sign that I should start getting my stuff together to move out. I plan on this taking about 2-6 months to get everything in order and have a place to go to when I move out. The thing is, I want to get my stuff in order before I tell my husband that I am wanting a divorce and that I am moving out. 
I’m starting to scrap and save money where I can. I am planning on shipping a lot of my valuables to my sister under the pretense that I am selling my stuff. I have always had a separate bank account from him so I’m ok on separate finances. My car is in both of our names but it’s paid off. I am looking at places for myself and my two dogs that I will be taking and will possibly have my brother move in to help with bills for awhile. 
My question is, what else should I do or know before I get a uhaul and throw my stuff in and get out? I want to keep this plan from my husband as long as I can. I don’t want him to know about this until I am already gone. I will take any advice y’all have, even if you think it’s common sense. Because this is my first “real break up” from a person and I don’t know what to do.

,Divorce,"A few months ago, I(29) discovered that my wife(28) of 5 years cheated on me with a trainer at the gym we were going to. I had a rough couple of weeks dealing with my emotions and deciding where I wanted to go. At the time, I decided that I would like to stay with her, as I still loved her and we have 2 children (4 &amp; 8). The oldest was a child from a previous relationship of hers, that I adopted after we got married. Once we made the decision to try to work things out, we went to marriage counseling for a few sessions. I was committed to making changes, but my wife tried her best to create a sob story and make it seem as if everything was my fault. She would make promises in therapy about changes she would make and would make attempts to rebuild the relationship, but it was just for show. She did stop going to that gym, but was pulling up the gym's website on a daily basis to see a picture of the guy. She frequently cleared her browser history and deleted messages/emails. It was clear that she had something to hide and checking up on her was causing me anxiety, so I stopped. 

In the following months, we seemed to be getting closer to each other and I thought we were on the upswing. That was, until today. Today, one of my kids handed me her iPad to get a show on it and he had her messages open. I found a group of messages between my wife and one of her classmates, where it appeared that her classmate was attempting to set her son up with my wife and my wife seemed excited. My wife just happened to be studying at this lady's house today and when I called, my calls were continuously left unanswered. When my wife finally came home, I confronted her about the messages. She admitted that she wants to be with someone else and was only going through the motions to make me happy. I told her that I feel we need a divorce, as I cannot see her making a change and actually being faithful in the relationship.

I am really concerned about a lot of aspects of the divorce process. I currently have a very good paying job (around 130k per year), but have over 100k in student loans remaining. She is currently in school, in a 1 year program. Previously, she worked various jobs, but none were high in income and she rarely stayed at a job for more than a year. We also purchased a house 2 years ago. The title is in both of our names, but the mortgage is only in mine, due to me having a much better credit score. We also have 2 vehicles that have not yet been paid off. 

I live in PA. I am curious as to what I am to expect in terms of cost of divorce, estimate of alimony (if any due to infidelity and apparent plans of future infidelity), and child support/custody. Shortly after cheating on me, she came clean and asked for a divorce and at the time, she stated that she doesnt want alimony or child support and that I could have the house, but would the court mandate any of that, even if she says she doesnt want it? Does my high student debt have any factor in alimony/child support, as it takes a significant portion of my paycheck?

&lt;p&gt;I also look at myself and think why I stayed in a mostly sexless marriage for so long with someone who put me down often. Why did I ever think this could get better? Why didn’t I love myself enough to leave? The task of rebuilding myself seems so daunting and I don’t know if I’m up to it.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"There was post earlier about how long you wanted out before you actually left/filed. 

This is my story... 

(2002) We had been dating for 2 years, (at this time he was 28, I was 22) everything was great! And this is true even in hindsight. He was fun, witty, romantic, wicked humor, and confident. 

(2003) We got engaged. Right before hand I started questioning where our relationship was going and if he was really ""The One"". I was not convinced, but there he was, on one knee, and oh crap how the hell do you say ""no"" to someone pledging their love and life to you? I mean who else was going to love me that much? Probably no one, so I say ""Yes"". Even that day serious red flags went soaring. Immediately after saying yes he throws out a snarky, ""I thought women were supposed to cry when they're proposed to."" 5 minutes after saying yes he forces me to call his sister and tell her she's a bridesmaid. I say, ""Of course she can be a bridesmaid, but I don't want to think about that stuff right now."" (I'm still trying to muster up some fake tears.) He shoves his phone in my face and yells at me to call her. Not wanting to ruin the day, I call her. This is 5 minutes after saying yes, my mom doesn't even know yet. 

(2005-2009) I squashed the growing doubts I had because I was now 24 and we just got done building our new house. (1st home for the both of us.) I just got a shiney new house! That's got to make up for the doubts and red flags, right? I am constantly reminded of how much he sacrificed to make the house a reality. He must really love me. His decisions and opinions are best, I'm just either silly or selfish. My friends are yuppies/hippies/losers/elitist, why would I want to hang out with them? They're too busy with their superficial lives, we are better off hanging out with his friends/family/cousins. This doesn't sit well with me, I know its wrong, but he convinces me he's right, and it's better than fighting, so I go with it.

(2006) I had been putting off getting married, stating our finances couldn't handle the cost of a wedding. (We had used our savings and the money his parents would put towards a wedding into building the house, a much better way to spend that $18,000.) Then my mom was diagnosed with cancer and near the end she mentioned in front of me and STBXh that she was heartbroken that she'd never see us get married. (We were engaged for 3 years at this point.) STBXh said we should get married, so we did, 5 days later in the hospital chapel. Who is going to deny their dying mother's wishes? Especially when STBXH also needs health insurance because he wants to hurry up and quit his job and start his own business without saving up money to make those shiney new mortgage payments. Even when I told him, DON'T QUIT YOUR JOB UNTIL WE HAVE 6 MONTHS OF YOUR CURRENT INCOME IN SAVINGS!! We had 1 months worth when I was guilted into getting married. He quit his job a week later. 

(2009) Yeah, his business flopped with the housing market in 2008. We almost lost the house twice. He wouldn't really hold a job for the next 2 years. I worked 2 jobs, he worked none. Once he got a decent job baby fever kicked in. Babies fix relationships, right?? He lost that job when kiddo was 2 weeks old. He made me put kiddo in daycare even though he was unemployed. Because just in case an interview came up, he wouldn't have to find a sitter. Because ya know, companies demand an applicant come in for same-day interviews, right? But it was easier than fighting, so we paid for full time daycare we didn't need and couldn't afford. 

(2014) Babies do not fix relationships. We have a 5 year old little boy, the light of my life. On a typical Thursday morning in February I find out via facebook that a close family member had committed suicide the day before. I was shocked, and sad, and angry that I found out via facebook. It was 6am. Typical workday though, still have to get kiddo to daycare and myself to work. STBXh decides it's a good morning to pick a fight. It got heated. I took my ring off and said I'm done I want a divorce. He took our son out of the car, told me I'd never see him again. Took my keys and said to walk to work. Locked the car. Locked me out of the house. It was February, in Wisconsin. It was fucking cold. This is the day I knew my exit had to be planned and executed swiftly with laser precision. I start looking at rentals, running numbers on my potential financial situation when leaving. It is daunting.

(2018) Trying to keep it together until kiddo is 18... ten years to go.... I'm a shell of my former self. Probably depressed. Crabby/tired/apathic all the time. Work 50-60 hrs a week because being at home makes me want to crawl out of my skin. Feel guilty for not wanting to be where my child is. I decide keeping him happy is easier than making myself happy. I want to say I'm walking on eggshells, but it's more, ""The floor is lava"". Kiddo (9yo at this point) starts trying to skimp on brushing his teeth, it's my fault for not enforcing proper technique when he was younger. He has an accident (#2) its my fault for potty training him too early. My car develops an exhaust leak, it's my fault because I dont take care of my car. (We live 6 miles from my work, apparently I'm supposed to drive around, twice a day mind you, until the exhaust tubes get hot enough for any moisture to evaporate. Funny though, his work is across the street from mine, and he never ""drives around"" to heat up his exhaust.. WTF?) Something in the lawnmower breaks, it my fault for mowing wrong.  I start exercising, I must be trying to impress other men. I go to the store, what took you so long? Kiddo and I are cuddling, talking in the living room, we're too loud, he cant hear the tv. We whisper. WHY ARE WE SO DISRESPECTFUL? ARE WE STUPID? He can't hear the YouTube videos he watches for 6 hours straight every night. Kiddo is sad, why doesn't daddy ever come to my soccer games? Or wrestling matches? Or martial arts? Kiddo says, ""I can't wait till I'm a dad and don't have to cook or clean.""

(Sept 2019) I find a place I can afford. I save up some $. I sign a lease. I file the divorce papers on a friday. Kiddo is at a birthday party the next day. I tell STBXh I'm moving out. I gather some things I had prepacked and hidden. I tell him dinner is in  the fridge. I pickup kiddo from bday party and we tell him together. STBXh tells kiddo mom is stealing money. (Because I had used ""our"" money to secure my new place.) STBXh tells kiddo mom would rather live in a shithole than with us. He says these things to our son, in front of me. This is the first and only time I cry. 

September 28th, 2019... is the day I finally stood up for myself and my child. Someday kiddo will see why I left.

,Divorce,"So the last few years its all about we're getting a divorce and finally in July it was we ARE 100% getting a divorce and soon and then just this week she tells me she has a layer so the same day I go and get one also.

Now for the last 2 years Ive been working hard to diffuse the situation and keep asking her to just calm down and lets try and work things out in a civilized manner. Yes divorce is coming but we can at least try and be nice to each other until our littlest one is 18, she's 9 now. I gave up all hope of that in July when she informed everyone, all the kids and myself that we were going to get a divorce ASAP. 

Up until today its been all about how I F'ed up the relationship and I'm a dirt-bag and she's going to get full custody so unless I want to lose everything then she wants half the assets and full custody or else. Again today she apologizes and asks if we can just be friends for the next 8 years and give it one last shot. She promised everything Ive been begging for but gave up hope on. Now that the layers are involved this has been shoved into reality the tone has changed completely. 

FUCK! Now what? I know we're never going to work things out and no matter what divorce is inevitable. But I love my kids and I don't want them in two houses. All day I keep telling myself that they'll be OK and mommy and daddy will be even better parents once we're separated. But still why couldn't she have done this a year ago.

&lt;p&gt;Now for the last 2 years Ive been working hard to diffuse the situation and keep asking her to just calm down and lets try and work things out in a civilized manner. Yes divorce is coming but we can at least try and be nice to each other until our littlest one is 18, she&amp;#39;s 9 now. I gave up all hope of that in July when she informed everyone, all the kids and myself that we were going to get a divorce ASAP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until today its been all about how I F&amp;#39;ed up the relationship and I&amp;#39;m a dirt-bag and she&amp;#39;s going to get full custody so unless I want to lose everything then she wants half the assets and full custody or else. Again today she apologizes and asks if we can just be friends for the next 8 years and give it one last shot. She promised everything Ive been begging for but gave up hope on. Now that the layers are involved this has been shoved into reality the tone has changed completely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FUCK! Now what? I know we&amp;#39;re never going to work things out and no matter what divorce is inevitable. But I love my kids and I don&amp;#39;t want them in two houses. All day I keep telling myself that they&amp;#39;ll be OK and mommy and daddy will be even better parents once we&amp;#39;re separated. But still why couldn&amp;#39;t she have done this a year ago. Hell even a few months ago and it may have actually made a difference. Now it feels to late. &lt;/p&gt;

My wife (34) and I (33) grew up in a very small community and were interested in each other from around the age of 13/14. We ""dated"" in middle school and a couple short periods in high school. She had other boyfriends and I had other girlfriends. She broke up with her boyfriend of 2+ years at the end of our senior year of HS, and we started dating very soon after. She remained friends with her ex, and I didn't like it. I made it very clear to her that I didn't like it, but she did it anyway, saying they were only friends and that she was never really ""in love with him."" Maybe true, maybe not, whatever. It's way in the past. We broke up after a year, she ended it, saying she just wasn't happy with me, or something similar. I was hurt/angry, but decided to move a couple hours away to go to college and when she heard I was moving, called me up, saying she made a mistake. We got back together, I still moved for the semester, and then came home, giving up my dream of going to school for architecture. I broke up with her a couple years later, basically because I just wasn't very happy with her and didn't see myself ever being happy with her long term. A couple weeks into being broken up, the ""what if I never find anyone else???"" thoughts started kicking in, and we got back together. We got engaged very soon after, and then married within 6 months. The beginning of the marriage was rough, but I chalked it up to her adjusting to the change, as she is someone who doesn't deal with changes very well. Cut to a few years later, we decide to have a child, now 7, and buy a house. Had another kid 4 years later, who just turned 3.

I've brought up my feelings to her a few times over the years, and said that I was considering divorce. But she of course was devastated each time, and I began to feel bad about causing her that pain. Then thinking about her with someone else, and my kids being around another man, not seeing my kids all the time...made me change my mind, as its easier to just stay than deal with all that. At least it seems that way.

She is selfish, and I am naturally very generous, but I find myself being an asshole to her more and more. After years of ""Whatever you want..."" I'm to the point of not caring what she wants. You know how people say ""They make me want to be a better person.""? She makes me want to be a worse person. She has an attitude most of the time, yelling or being shitty to me or the kids over issues that are completely insignificant. 

I think I stayed with her through the years because of insecurities about myself. I already got over those hurdles with her, and would have to deal with them if I started over. Then we had a child, and that's what kept me around. Then we had another. Now, I can't stand the thought of not seeing my kids every day, but I also don't know that I can keep going down the same path with my her. I find myself drinking more, probably as a buffer to my reality. I'm constantly thinking about what it would be like to be with someone else, and how I'm wasting my life, and potential happiness, staying with her.

,Divorce,"Hi all.  It's been about two weeks since I posted [my introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/degf3g/37m_ending_samesex_marriage_with_40m_requesting/).  I have a few additional questions to which I'm hoping you all can provide insight.

Quick recap of background info:  I (M/37) decided I want to end my my same-sex marriage with my husband (M/40).  We have three adopted children (all boys / 9, 6, 4).  We live in Indiana (a no-fault, no alimony state) with my mother-in-law who owns the house.  I work nights. My husband is a stay-at-home dad/spouse/homeschool teacher.  We were hoping for amenable separation.  


Since my last post, my MIL came back from out-of-state. She wrote me a note asking me to vacate the premise by November 30.  She is divorced three times, and I think she is attempting to be kind yet neutral.  I am hoping to find a place by October 31 since my husband already wants me out of the house already.  Emotionally, I am getting good moral support from family and friends, but I am stressing over the logistics of moving out.  

My questions:

&amp;#x200B;

* Having the talk with the kids:  We have not yet discussed the upcoming changes with the kids.  I am hoping to get guidance when my husband and I meet with our marriage counselor this week. Does anyone have good advice for sitting the family together to discuss the separation?
* Child support:  I earn approximately $2400 monthly.  My husband brings in no income.  The children are awarded in approximately $2100 in adoption assistance from the state.  If I used the state's [calculator](https://public.courts.in.gov/csc#/parents-home) correctly, I'll be paying $624 in child support.  Does that sound in-line with what other people contribute?
* Separation housing requirements:  We are trying for amicable separation, but I'm thinking of custody issues in case they come up.  Currently, the three boys all share a room.  They would likely be with me during weekends.  Two-bedroom apartments in my area would push my budget to where I'm not sure I could pay child support.  Getting a studio or 1-bedroom with den would fit in my budget &amp; allow me to pay what the projected child support amount will be (if I calculated correctly).  However, will I be denied child custody if they don't have a separate room?   
* Living out-of-state:  Alternatively, my mother has offered for me to move in with her during the separation and after the divorce until I get back on my feet.  My step-dad has offered to help me get work near their home.  However, their home is several states away.  They say I need to make sure I take care of myself first.  I have two concerns:  I want to remain near the kids so I can still be part of their lives as much as possible, and I currently have a job with good benefits.  However, do I have the wrong priorities?

Debating if I should warn her what is coming or not. We've both moved out of our home and she has been keeping my child from me and accusing me of things such as abuse in the process.

Thoughts everyone? Should I speak with her? Maybe even just to warn her so she's not blindsided? She must know what's coming I have moved out fully and she still has all her stuff in the home?

She actually wanted to meet last thing she texted me was she wanted ""to talk"".

Anyway so we had agreed that she was going to pay for the divorce as she was the one who wanted out But we were told that Aus law requires us to wait 12 months after we separate.

Anyway so we had agreed that she was going to pay for the divorce as she was the one who wanted out But we were told that Aus law requires us to wait 12 months after we separate.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"I’m 43F and my husband is 44M. Married 4 years, living together 10, together total of 12. No kids by choice. Things were fantastic for many years, but then he slowly over time became less interested in sex (I practically had to force him ... then I gave up), less interested in communicating and would get upset when I would try, became sort of emotionally numb to me. He did all the major things a husband is supposed to do, except *love me*.   (And I’m a good looking woman. I look hot in a bikini and get hit on constantly.)

I had more conversations and arguments about our relationship than I could ever count. I tried everything I possibly could. Eventually, I moved into the guest room. He never tried to get me to move back into our room or to work on the relationship. 

After 5 or 6 months of that, I told him I was going to move out and I did. He didn’t try to stop me. That was May 1. 

Throughout the summer I’ve had some health problems that he was mostly there for to help me with. And right now I have a broken ankle and I’m on a cast, and he took my 110-pound dog that I obviously can’t walk like this. 

A few weeks ago he tells me that he just doesn’t love me anymore (over the phone). He was about to go on a business trip, so I said that when he gets back he needs to bring over all his financials so we can file the divorce paperwork (we plan to do it uncontested). 

Then he tells me he’s confused and wants to try to reconcile. Which, if possible, would be my choice. 

Another week goes by of him doing nothing. I get mad, ask what he thinks the reconciliation process looks like, he says he doesn’t know, I get mad bc there’s only about 10 millions websites about this topic on google. I say, screw this, come over and we’re doing the divorce papers. 

He comes over, really swears he wants to try to reconcile. I ask how, explicitly. We agree. 

Another week goes by, we talk a little more but none of the things we originally agreed to. He goes away for a week on a business trip, I saw him today for about an hour and asked him what his thoughts so far on the reconciliation were, and he said good, except for the times he got texts from me where he thought it seemed like I might cry so he didn’t want to engage in that. 

Then I texted him later how disappointing all of that was for me and then the rest of the night he was sending super nice or funny texts. 

I’ve stopped getting my hopes up, but I don’t understand his motivation.

,Divorce,"I'm not really sure where to start or how I feel. I'm 28 and my husband is 32. Married for 6 years, together for 9. 

Two days ago, my husband and I got into a fight. Once again, I was giving him a hard time about some minor thing. I ate and instantly felt better a realized I was being a hangry idiot. My husband lost it. I've never seen him so mad. This was obviously the last straw for him. He told me he was sick of me picking at him, sick of me being in school (year 4/5 of undergrad) sick of me not working, sick of me not driving. Specifically, he said he was sick of being my ATM and chauffeur. I told him I was sick of being his mom and personal assistant. He left.

24 hours later I told him I needed to talk. I needed to know what I was going to do. I needed to know what was happening. He came back home last night at 11pm to talk. He told me we hadn't been working for a while. We both made each other feel insignificant and like we'd never be enough for each other. He told me he didn't want to see a marriage counsellor and that he probably wouldn't change his mind. I told him I felt like I was being thrown away like garbage. He told me he needed to learn how to take care of himself. He said one of us had to move out. His parents are flying here on Sunday (tomorrow) to help him figure everything out. 

Last night, my mum came over and helped me load my clothes, my dog, and some other things into her car. I'm now staying in her spare bedroom indefinitely. I'm a full time student with a 100lb dog living in an expensive city. I'm scared about the future. I'm not completely ready to let go of my marriage. I wish he'd agree to a trial separation so we can both get better and go on from there. I don't know what to do. I just lost my best friend. 

I should also add that I have contemplated separation several times over the years. I've always wondered if our marriage was the best thing for us. However, I stuck around because of love and fear. We have grown apart in a lot of ways and developed different interests and life desires. He always talks about wanting to move away and go live in the desert or go start a metal band or go do graffiti. He has said he has a desire to blow his life up just for the thrill of it. 

Now I don't know if I should just completely let go, or if there is a possibility that we'll be able to reconcile after some time apart to work on ourselves. Where I live, a couple has to be separated for one year before they can divorce. I believe we need time apart to figure out who we really are, want we really want, and if we can continue with the marriage or stay apart forever. I don't know if he feels the same. 

I just desperately need advice and help if anyone has some to give. If not, this has been really cathartic. Thank you.

Specifically, he said he was sick of being my ATM and chauffeur. I told him I was sick of being his mom and personal assistant. He left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24 hours later I told him I needed to talk. I needed to know what I was going to do. I needed to know what was happening. He came back home last night at 11pm to talk. He told me we hadn&amp;#39;t been working for a while. We both made each other feel insignificant and like we&amp;#39;d never be enough for each other. He told me he didn&amp;#39;t want to see a marriage counsellor and that he probably wouldn&amp;#39;t change his mind. I told him I felt like I was being thrown away like garbage. He told me he needed to learn how to take care of himself. He said one of us had to move out. His parents are flying here on Sunday (tomorrow) to help him figure everything out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, my mum came over and helped me load my clothes, my dog, and some other things into her car. I&amp;#39;m now staying in her spare bedroom indefinitely. I&amp;#39;m a full time student with a 100lb dog living in an expensive city. I&amp;#39;m scared about the future. I&amp;#39;m not completely ready to let go of my marriage. I wish he&amp;#39;d agree to a trial separation so we can both get better and go on from there. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I just lost my best friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also add that I have contemplated separation several times over the years. I&amp;#39;ve always wondered if our marriage was the best thing for us. However, I stuck around because of love and fear. We have grown apart in a lot of ways and developed different interests and life desires. He always talks about wanting to move away and go live in the desert or go start a metal band or go do graffiti. He has said he has a desire to blow his life up just for the thrill of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I don&amp;#39;t know if I should just completely let go, or if there is a possibility that we&amp;#39;ll be able to reconcile after some time apart to work on ourselves. Where I live, a couple has to be separated for one year before they can divorce. I believe we need time apart to figure out who we really are, want we really want, and if we can continue with the marriage or stay apart forever. I don&amp;#39;t know if he feels the same. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just desperately need advice and help if anyone has some to give. If not, this has been really cathartic. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I should also note that he has been telling a lot of people whereas I haven&amp;#39;t been telling many people at all. I feel like my privacy is being violated.&lt;/p&gt;

We have twins (3) of which we have shared custody and we split the time evenly.

Our divorce was amicable, that is, we haven't went through trials but just laid out the terms on paper, signed and verified in the court, etc. No fuss, no nothing. We also take turns according to kids' and our own needs, so e.g. sometimes they are longer with me and vice-versa.

She's (26) with another man (52) with whom she started a relationship not long ago after the D-bomb (February). She announced the relationship to the world about two weeks ago, we're legally divorced for one month. I (35) moved out about three weeks ago.

OK, those were the important bits.

Now, she's gotten batshit crazy into some regional YouTube motivational speaker to the point of being a zealot, shit you not. Although that speaker has some fair points, she's taking it waaay too seriously and I'm not the only one noticing that. It's all about how you ""vibrate"" on low and high frequencies, that we all have vortexes of our desires... Etc.

Long story short, as a part of that learning she' s forcing way too hard on being friends, like best buddies and such. And... That bothers me. A lot. I don't want to get back, but I don't want to be friends either. A team for the kids, yes, but nothing more than that. The last thing I did for her as a friend was to help her get a job, and this is 95% done, the rest is up to her and I don't have any effect on those 5% anyway. And I did it mostly so the kids can have a secure income from her side too.

This forced friendship has been bothering me so much lately that I implied a few times that she should not except anything more than being a team for kids, but she's been continuing subtly pushing this friendship thing again and again.

Finally, the main part. If you followed so far, please read this:

This evening at around 11pm (Europe, 4am now) I sent a lenghty text with exactly laid out reasons why this ""friendship"" cannot work and what I think our relationship should be: a team for the kids, no further sharing of personal information, talks about job, life, etc. I pointed out the reasons (which I would not like to share here, but she did some horrible stuff that hurt me really bad) for impossibility of friendship ever working out.

Basically, I want to cut all connections to her and her life, except for the kids related stuff. I want to be able to move on with my life without her asking ""how are you holding on?"" ""nice perfume!"" ""grab me some smokes while you're on your way to pick up kids"", etc. I have a feeling in my gut that tells me she's doing this so she can say tomorrow that she tried to have a healthy relationship, but I was tjhe one ruining it. Like, I'm the bad guy in the end in public eyes.

My mind is constantly running, pouring over everything that went wrong. His mistakes. My mistakes.

Today, the home that we shared together went on the market. I spent the entire week there, cleaning, painting and giving the entire space a facelift. One that made our home feel like it already belonged to someone else, the memories we made no longer visible. I found confetti from concerts we had gone to together.

I picked these up, one by one, then tossed them into a garbage bag, along with everything else. Into the trash bin, just where he tossed our relationship as he walked away without giving me any closure or peace.

Last weekend, he was at a music festival. This week, he has flown off to Amsterdam. His social media profile now captions ""Music is life"" and ""Want to go on an adventure?"" I had to block him completely, then some friends to avoid seeing his photos. I feel crushed every time I see his face, smiling as he goes on to live his best life, bouncing from adventure to adventure without me by his side. Knowing that he doesn't think of me or regret leaving as he is out meeting new people and pushing what we shared further and further into his past. 

Our divorce will be final in a matter of weeks now. There isn't much to argue over, no kids, the pets are with me, finances have been split. I know that the day is coming where I will be signing the paper that dissolves me from his life. That erases the 15 years that we have spent together.

Fear of being alone and heartbroken forever is holding me back from letting go. I miss the way he held me, how there was no fear when I was wrapped in his arms. I miss the man I called my partner and my best friend, the person that knows me inside and out. The person I thought would never hurt me.

Into the trash bin, just where he tossed our relationship as he walked away without giving me any closure or peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, he was at a music festival. This week, he has flown off to Amsterdam. His social media profile now captions &amp;quot;Music is life&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Want to go on an adventure?&amp;quot; I had to block him completely, then some friends to avoid seeing his photos. I feel crushed every time I see his face, smiling as he goes on to live his best life, bouncing from adventure to adventure without me by his side. Knowing that he doesn&amp;#39;t think of me or regret leaving as he is out meeting new people and pushing what we shared further and further into his past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our divorce will be final in a matter of weeks now. There isn&amp;#39;t much to argue over, no kids, the pets are with me, finances have been split. I know that the day is coming where I will be signing the paper that dissolves me from his life. That erases the 15 years that we have spent together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear of being alone and heartbroken forever is holding me back from letting go. I miss the way he held me, how there was no fear when I was wrapped in his arms. I miss the man I called my partner and my best friend, the person that knows me inside and out. The person I thought would never hurt me. I miss the way he kissed my neck and nuzzled me as we went to bed. Every night, I tuck myself into bed now, curling up beside my sweet dog, I kiss her goodnight, scratch her belly and hope that tomorrow will be even a tiny bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"42F married to a 45M. We have been together for 26 years, married for 24. We were virgins. 2 years ago he attempted suicide. I'd encouraged him for a long time to get therapy - he never had but I've been going for yrs for my own mental illness - but I had no clue that his depression was that severe. Despite a gunshot wound to the face, after multiple surgeries he looks nearly back to himself. It has been called miraculous. He considered it a second chance and a gift from God (we had not been religious). 

When he was in the psychiatric hospital and I visited him, he said ""no more secrets"". Except...

2 weeks after his attempt I found out that he had been cheating on me for 5 years with someone he met on Ashley Madison. Since our daughter was 2. It basically just sounds like meeting up in hotel rooms for sex. She has kids, divorced her husband, and expected him to do the same. He told her he would and that he loved her. But told me that he didn't love her &amp; never had any intention of leaving me.  He's is a compulsive liar, so who knows?

I thought he was hanging out with friends and playing poker at those times. He had a secret bank account to fund it all. I parented alone as a stay at home mom and worked part time from home, going without sleep, to earn extra money.  While he was spending money on hotel rooms.  

I found out he was cheating when OW sent a birthday/get well card to our house and I opened it. Pretty normal to open each other's mail (especially as I was his support person and counseled to filter his mail, media viewing, etc., more on that later). It was unsigned obvious that it was from another woman. Still he refused to admit it - staring directly into my eyes -  until I said I was leaving him right then and there if he didn't tell the truth. 

He really gave no reason why he did it other than it was exciting. It boosted his ego. He had low self esteem. He had been hurt by my responses to some work issues he'd been having. Not that he mentioned that to me. 

We'd had problems before and I wanted to seek therapy. He said he'd find a counselor but kept putting it off. Our sex life had its ups and downs but good when we did do it. He said he had a low libido. Riiight.

We have a 10 year old daughter, and she is now in therapy. She doesn't know details other than that he was shot in the face at work. In addition to dealing with the radical changes in her life, we have found out that she may be on the autism spectrum. She has a lot of emotional issues, and is also entering puberty.

We had marriage counseling while he was in a psychiatric hospital outpatient program right after the attempt, and then some more sessions with a therapist once he was out. Ultimately she said that we needed to work on ourselves individually first. We agreed that she wasn't right for us anyway so put it on hold. We never restarted it. I have been in therapy myself for 7 years. 

For the first year or so I was really hopeful. We decided to see if we could work things out. We had dates, made time to talk about our feelings, etc. It seemed like we could make it work.  But slowly he quit doing the ""homework"" and doing things we both agreed to. All talk and no action. I realized that I had been putting in all of the work and he wasn't doing anything. The pattern of our whole marriage. 

So I decided to step back and see if he could/would step up. He didn't. I asked him to move into the spare room and he seemed shocked. I discussed an ""in house separation"" for 6 months and gave him some info about it that my therapist had shared. He never read it, but he agreed to do whatever I wanted to do. To ""be better"". 

He has been going to therapy weekly, seeing his psychiatrist, attending Emotions Anonymous. He started some volunteering, talking to mental health patients.  But no efforts were made towards improving our relationship or his relationship with our daughter. I talk and I'm stonewalled. He's just waited for me to stop talking so he can return to his phone, tablet, book, or TV.  I gave up talking was about anything emotional whatsoever. Just logistics. 

He has had days of not showering and doing nothing but other days I have come home from work and he's been productive all day. I never knew who I'd come home to. Upbeat and productive or uncommunicative unwashed lump in bed.  I suspect he has not been honest with his therapist, group, etc., about how much of a rollercoaster his moods have been. Here's making his own reality that doesn't include being a husband and father.

He retired early from his job due to disability (he has a pension) and has been in the process of getting SSDI. He can never return to his profession again because of where he attempted. It made national news. He was also charged with a felony due to where he discharged the gun, and was sentenced to probation and community service. 

I can't afford to pay rent and take care of my daughter so I got a certification over the summer, and have been looking for a better paying job so we could move out. I've been biding my time. 

When it hit the 2 year mark since I found out of all this - in August - it's like it all really gelled into reality.  There is no hope.  Our marriage is dead. I never knew this man. He's got narcissistic personality traits. I have attempted to control everything in a very codependent way. 

I went into a deeper depression recently.  I was already diagnosed with PTSD on top of depression and anxiety. I couldn't work my IT/ help desk job - just too many people making demands of me all day. I'm a month into medical leave, and going on short term disability. 

My therapist very bluntly said that I have to get out now. I will only get more depressed and angry. He's like cement blocks dragging me down under the water. I can't heal until I'm not living with him anymore.  

At the end of November we are moving in with my parents until I find a new job. I don't want to do it, but I also can't live with this emotionless robot who can talk about his feelings with strangers but not me. Who does nothing whatsoever around the house or with parenting unless I beg. I'm grateful my parents offered and have the space.  We haven't always had amazing relationships but I believe that they love me and want to help. 

But I've known this man since I was 16. I don't know how to be on my own or single. I have to start a new life and I'm scared as hell. I don't know who I am. I cry so hard that I physically ache. I'm having a hard time making myself pack and move forward.

,Divorce,"Hi r/divorce -

I have the divorce trial at the start of November; it has been a brutal case full of lies.

Using the recovery site ""http://redditsearch.io"" I uncovered all the data in three of her Reddit profiles that date back to 2011. 

Everything that she says regarding the divorce as well as her self identity, career realities, etc. contradicts itself.

I have this along with artwork and writings that detail a similar mix of chaotic items as well as items of non digital, physical evidence that praise me for my parenting and efforts throughout the years. I have data from other websites too.

Most of this material as it relates to our relationship as a married couple shows -in her own words- how much she loves me, and how much support I give to her. 

So

She lied on court documents, and lied on an order of protection. These are items that she submitted to her lawyers, the guardian ad litem, and the judge in our case.

I don't know what I should do. 

Evidence submission is over on Tuesday, and I don't have the money or time to print and organize this material for evidence.

I also gave the last of my money away to someone I know who was facing a horrible abuse situation at their home so that they could survive and not be homeless.

So I am sort of screwed economically even though I did the right thing.

I don't want to submit this material to court. I don't want to harm my wife even though she has harmed me and our daughter, my career opportunities, continued education, and friendships.

So I have no idea what to do.

&lt;p&gt;Using the recovery site &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""http://redditsearch.io""&gt;http://redditsearch.io&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; I uncovered all the data in three of her Reddit profiles that date back to 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything that she says regarding the divorce as well as her self identity, career realities, etc. contradicts itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this along with artwork and writings that detail a similar mix of chaotic items as well as items of non digital, physical evidence that praise me for my parenting and efforts throughout the years. I have data from other websites too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this material as it relates to our relationship as a married couple shows -in her own words- how much she loves me, and how much support I give to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She lied on court documents, and lied on an order of protection. These are items that she submitted to her lawyers, the guardian ad litem, and the judge in our case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what I should do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence submission is over on Tuesday, and I don&amp;#39;t have the money or time to print and organize this material for evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also gave the last of my money away to someone I know who was facing a horrible abuse situation at their home so that they could survive and not be homeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am sort of screwed economically even though I did the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to submit this material to court. I don&amp;#39;t want to harm my wife even though she has harmed me and our daughter, my career opportunities, continued education, and friendships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have no idea what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to help me troubleshoot the ethics of this all, please feel free to comment. I am pro se in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

No one called me or even came to see me. ) So the last I saw of anyone was when I had my medical documents including the operating report and took it to my so called parents house, many of the family were there at the time and gave them the report. I was then told I was still lying and they were going to call the cops. I picked up the phone and said I would call what did they want me to say!

By the way I am a 60 year old female on limited disability (which started many yearsbefore I filed for divorce) I had one brain tumor removed after filing for divorce and have another that I pray never grows. My children and entire family no longer speak to me because I HE told them I never had a brain tumor, ( FYI - I called them the day I found out and told everyone that I was getting it removed in less than a week and where I was having it done. No one called me or even came to see me. ) So the last I saw of anyone was when I had my medical documents including the operating report and took it to my so called parents house, many of the family were there at the time and gave them the report. I was then told I was still lying and they were going to call the cops. I picked up the phone and said I would call what did they want me to say! I was then told  told to leave and said fine picked up the report and threw it at the main bitch and said fuck you. I don&amp;#39;t feel bad about any of that but have been harassed bycops with multiple false police reports and wonder if that could be the reason why this is getting held up. There&amp;#39;s not much to get resolved but I am being jerked around by the court system. Is there any way to find out WHY??? I  am struggling through this and cannot find anything out.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Hi everyone, recently separated and soon to be formally divorced. I have been lurking this sub for a while for validation and wanted to share a bit of my story. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my post history, I had been over on r/relationships when my husband of 3 years had moved out west for work and disclosed to me that he had been having feelings for other people, and that he was questioning his sexuality. At that time, we'd explored the idea of an open marriage so that he can fulfill that need for intimacy while he was away. Unfortunately, communication broke down with him as soon as I had consented to an open marriage, and things spiraled from there. The way that I saw it; I could either consent to an open marriage and know what he's doing/who he's sleeping with- or say no and not know what is happening until I find out at a later date. This is how I knew that things were \*done\* done, but hey, I'm young. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cue him moving home. I had read all of the books I could find on non-monogamy and listened to all of the podcasts. I was ready to do hours of self-reflection for every date that I would go on and dedicated at least an hour per week to hang out with stbxh and debrief. He downloaded Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and would sit on his phone for hours, swiping and messaging and not communicating with me. He started dating older women, and when I asked what was up with that, he responded that they ""have nicer figures."" The turning point for me came when he changed his phone lock password and started disappearing at nights without telling me where he was going. 

&amp;#x200B;

Asking him to move out was a feat. He hadn't been cleaning up after himself or doing any household tasks, and was letting food rot on plates all around his sleeping space on the couch before I would get frustrated and clean up. I come home from work and he's been hanging out on the couch all day smoking pot and playing video games, which is a new thing for him. He first had asked to stay in the home for an additional 6 months to ""get up on his feet"" as he hasn't been paying rent since May due to part-time hours, but I finally gave him an ultimatum to be gone by November 1st or I would be changing the locks. I know that's illegal given that he's still on the lease, but he hadn't been looking at apartments or rooms to rent at all prior to the threat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the important pieces. I have consulted with a lawyer and drafted a separation agreement which he has signed. We were married for under 5 years so he has minimal claim to anything of mine. Everything in the apartment was purchased by me and he has agreed and signed that the only things he will take are his own clothes and his coffee maker. We've told our friends and families and I've been surrounded with so much support- everything from friends taking me out for coffee every night so that I don't have to be in the home while stbxh is, to frozen soups dropped off in my entryway. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've also been in weekly therapy for the past few years and have been focusing on the specific issues which have led me to this place in my marriage to start with- my low self-esteem, a history of abuse which led me to think that \*this\* is the best thing I could hope for in a husband, and lack of healthy boundaries. Emotionally, I feel like things have been done for a few months now and as I reflect on little things in my life, I feel like I have just known but have been too scared to act. A silly example of this would be a few tarot card readings that I had which said I'm ""resisting an inevitable end,"" or ""I need to let go of a relationship that no longer serves me."" I would always have this gut feeling that I'm unhappy, but never considered divorce to be an option, because obviously being unhappy and with someone would be better than risking being alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I just wanted to share my journey. I feel like a huge weight is lifted off my chest and I'm soooooo excited for what will come next.

I finally have time this weekend to go back to get the rest of my things. I told him last week that I planned on coming this weekend. 

It’s a long drive and a short weekend, so my mom and I were planning on leaving late tonight and driving through the night. It’s a 13-hr drive. 

Now, he’s texting me saying he has changed the code on the locks (it’s a keyless door with a 4-digit code) and that he doesn’t feel comfortable with me going to *his* house. 

I thought we were amicable. When I told him I was leaving, we were friendly for the next two days while I packed and tied up my loose ends in Oklahoma. We even shared a bed those last two days, not having sex, just coinhabitating. 

Now he’s acting like he doesn’t trust me to finish packing my stuff. He’ll be gone this weekend for work, so technically if I was a bad person I guess I could rob him. But then I’m sure he’d take me to court, and we were planning on doing this divorce thing without needing that. 

He must have forgot that I have an app for the “smart home” system and can unlock the door from my phone. I didn’t mention this to him though cause I don’t want him to kick me out of the system. But I think I’m still going to leave tonight as planned and not tell him I’m coming. My name is still on that damn lease so I will come get my stuff when I want to. 

Why would I want any of his crap anyway? I don’t want to bring home any reminders of him. He’s acting like he has a reason to not trust me, but I haven’t done anything wrong. No kids, no house (the house he is in is a rental), no affairs, just irreconcilable differences. I don’t understand why he thinks I’m out to get him. 

Also, he asked for a list of everything I was getting, and the printer was on the list (I bought it in college so it’s mine). He texts back “The printer? Are you f*cking kidding me?” Like who gets that upset over a printer?!

,Divorce,"My mood was flipped on its head yesterday. I use a journaling app (Day One) and it gives me a notification if I have any entries on this date in years past. Yesterday, my head was in a bad place. It was panning out to be a pretty shitty day. Then I got my Day One App notification. I had made two journal entries on 10/17 in years past. One was from four years ago and was insignificant. The other, from 2018. In that entry I mentioned how much I hated my life and how unhappy I was in my marriage.  This really made me think of why I’m so down about the end of my marriage. Why would I want to go back into that situation?

I search through the app and found several more of me describing my unhappiness with the marriage. One was particularly intriguing. It was dated 8/7/18 (and I do remember re-reading it this past 8/7). It was titled “Note to future me” and it read along the lines of, I had a lengthy discussion with my wife and explained to her how unhappy I was and what I needed from her. When I asked her what she needed from me, she said she didn’t know, and that she was just going to ride it out and hope things improved. Well, they didn’t just magically fix themselves and here we are. The end of that entry read “if nothing has changed when you read this, it may be time to make that hard decision”. Well, she was the one who made decision because I didn’t back on 8/7/19. 

Since she told me she wanted a divorce last week, all I’ve been focused on was the good times we’ve had in the past (and we did have a lot of good times) as well as the future plans we had made that will no longer come true. I hadn’t been thinking about how unhappy I had been the past couple years nor that her idea of working on the marriage is to wait and see what happens.

,Divorce,"I got divorced in early September. It wasn't my decision and was something I tried to avoid. Over the course of our marriage I was told several times by my ex wife, ""I'm not meant for marriage"" or ""I think I would be happier I were single"" or ""I don't love you the way you want"". I generally brushed this aside as self doubt on her part.

Then by the fourth time she said we should get divorced I gave up. Over the next several months the statements changed to ""I'm not meant to be married to you"", ""I never loved you"", ""I could be happy married to someone else"".

Needless to say this hurt, and still does to some degree. 

The problem I am asking for advice around is overcoming the feelings of inadequacy or jealousy about her having a relationship, or even just the potential, with someone else. I know we're divorced and that it is over. I'm just having a difficult time getting my heart, and sometimes mind, to acknowledge and move on. I realize that I may be unfairly judging my weaknesses against someones strengths. And I find my thoughts drifting towards, what does he, or could, offer that I couldn't.

When we talk the go to conversation is about her work, but it’s like she doesn’t want to have a 2 way conversation because if I try to engage she’ll tell me that I don’t understand or even get angry with me if I ask questions.  It’s more just for her own satisfaction to be talking/venting about work.  She makes me feel like a second class citizen and I don’t feel appreciated for the work I put into our lives.

Since we have young kids, its likely we are going to need to work out some differences, at least until they are off to college.  Every argument we have dredges up things they were mad about years ago, name calling, ridicule, etc.

Everyone argues differently, I'm sure I have my own tactics, but this is getting frustrating to no end.  I don't even want to get in a discussion with this person since it just because it just becomes an endless rant from them that can go on for hours.  Main points that keep coming up.  I'm not what they expected to me, I didn't treat them how they expected at various moments in life, I don't have any friends, and that I'm selfish.  I'm confident enough that the names don't matter to me.  I am setting up boundaries and sticking up for myself, which is construed as selfish.  Whatever.  I don't feel like peace is achievable here because its always about what they want.

This person keeps trying to burn me and I just no longer care what they have to say.  What am I going to do the next decade and a half while we raise the kids if we never can discuss anything? Its not worth disagreeing with this person, they are just itching for a fight and can drag it out for hours if I play ball.

Tagging as rant, but I'm really interested in how others have handled life after divorce from someone who doesn't want to be reasoned with.  (sorry i'm new here)

It seems like no matter what I try, therapy, medication, work, moving, time with friends, exercise... nothing will heal the rift in my heart. It goes soul deep.

I'm having an extremely hard time seeing the point to try and heal anymore. I have to be honest, I think about killing myself. Every day. All day.

I think about it and I'm close to doing it. I just can't live in pain like this anymore. I had truckloads of trauma before the divorce.

During the divorce I lost my job, my first job that I could consider a career, and my place of residence because of that. I've been homeless-ish ever since. I haven't been on a lease or paperwork of any kind since 2016.

I can't keep going like this. I just work a shitty coffee job to pay what small bills I have while I couch surf with a friend.

I don't tell my therapist how close I am to hanging myself in the woods because I don't want her to contact the authorities.

I feel utterly and totally alone and without much hope.

There doesn't seem to be a solution other than death.

Please help me. Help me believe that there's something left to try. Something reason to stay because right now... I don't see much of one. Everything I had that I fought so hard to gain, every ounce of my effort to fight my way out of the poverty I was born into has meant nothing. And my wife was my only family. I loved her so much. Without her....

,Divorce,"Me (39f), STBXh (46m)
Married 13y, together 19y
1 house, 1 son (10yo), 1 dog (3 yo)

I left 3 weeks ago. And I have to say that even though I now live with 2 bachelor housemates and sleep on airmatress and live out of rubbermaid drawers, I am loving every minute of being out!! No more watching what I say, or being afraid of what's going to piss him off, or in what new way I'm going to look like an idiot to him. No more being in charge of literally every aspect of our married life.

I rent a room, not a full apartment. Meaning my son and I would have to share this room when he's with me. Because if this, the day I left I gave my son a choice of staying with dad in the house or coming with me. He chose to stay with Dad, which I understand. 

I visit every evening to see my son and ask how his day went, to read with him in bed, give hugs and kisses goodnight, which we've done every night since he was a toddler. Then STBXh and I talk for bit before I leave. I'm there for about 1.5 hrs.

These conversations with STBX have evolved from him telling me, ""I'm going to crush you"" and ""You're destroying our child"" to him crying like a baby saying, ""Its all my fault, I'll fix everything"" and ""We're a great team, if we both want to save the marriage we can"".

STBX is a vicious, vindictive, spiteful, human. I want to say narcissistic, because he sure fits the bill, but I'm no psychologist. 

I have been nice to him during these 3 weeks I've been out. I make sure he has groceries, make sure our son has clean laundry, leave instructions on how to cook dinner. (He never once cooked or cleaned in 13 years of marriage. My son once said, ""I can't wait until I'm a dad so I dont have to cook or clean."")

In an effort to keep the peace I agreed to counseling before putting the house up for sale. (Probably shouldn't have done that.) I told him I'll go, but with zero expectation of me changing my mind.

I have zero desire to save the marriage. I've already mourned the relationship and have been emotionally detached for years (no sex for 3+ years...). But I do care FOR him, I want him to be a good dad and happy. 

STBX has told me a few times, ""I defended you when our son started blaming you for leaving. I told him it was all my fault and that I'm going to fix it. If you don't move back in after counseling I'm just going to tell him you're selfish and don't love us anymore.""  He also added this little nugget, ""Since you left us, legally you get nothing, but I'm LETTING you in the house to see our son and grab more of your stuff."" (I know this is BS, I was stunned that he thought I'd fall for it!!)

How the F*** am I supposed respond to that? If I'm brutally honest with STBX my relationship with my child is essential ruined, if I maintain the facade, I'm living a whole other lie. 

Am I being too accommodating? 
Is it worth the damage STBX will inflict on my relationship with my son, so I can be brutally honest?

,Divorce,"TLDR: Ex-husband is a lazy pothead who doesn't do anything and I'm tired of him being portrayed as a perfect parent.

I'm so frustrated!!! I HATE this state!! Here in Nevada, custody is just about always 50/50. There are very rare circumstances where primary custody is awarded to a parent. And right now, in this moment, it's making me so angry!

Now to be clear, I know I'm not the perfect mommy. I never claimed to be. But my ex-husband's behavior is really getting to me. When we were married, I was the primary caregiver to our daughter. I took care of EVERYTHING. I made any appointments she needed, set up, scheduled, and paid for daycare, did the food shopping, bought all her clothes and toys, knew when she needed diapers or soap or when she grew out of her clothes and needed new ones and bought them. I signed her up for activities and scheduled them. I did it all. When she was sick I took care of her, when he was sick, even if I was too, I took care of her AND him. When he was going through a depressive episode, I took care of her. The last 2 months before he left, I was the only one working. I paid for daycare for 1 month while he was home because he was depressed. The last month he was home I would come home on my lunch break to feed her and check on them. Then I would come home and take care of her while he sat in the garage smoking pot. Then he left and saw her for a few hours a week for about a month.

Fast forward to now, we have 50/50 custody. The court doesn't care that I was always the primary caregiver. That all summer when she was with him, she would spend 4/7 days a week at his mother's house so he could go off and do whatever he wanted. Or that he smokes so much pot that his house permanently reeks and our daughter tells me that he is always in his garage. Smoking pot.

This is her week with me. She was sick the last 2 days and I had to take time off work. Yesterday I asked him at 7 in the morning if he could take her today if she was still sick and he didn't respond until 4:30 in the afternoon. I was going to send her to school until the babysitter texted me at work and told me she woke up feeling awful and she was going to his house for the day. And when I picked her up from his house, it stunk to high heaven. On the way home I told her that I tried to call her on my lunch break and she told me that Daddy missed the call because he was in the garage. Smoking pot.

I just wish I could take her full time and let her see him on the weekends. I still take care of everything for her. His family praises him for being this Oh so wonderful dad because they enable him and refuse to see the truth. It's so infuriating. They think I'm a horrible person and it makes me so angry. When we were married they didn't want to see that I did everything, and even less so now. He left me. He broke up this family and wanted to be a single dad.

Im so sick of being the one to want to fix anything.  Ten years we have been married and for approximately 8 of those years I have been reading Marriage Self Help books.  Ways to better your marriage, ways to have a better relationship, the love languages, the Christian perspective, Kiss Me Like you Mean it.  

Since the very first self help marriage book I picked up I knew something was way wrong because he wouldn't read it.  He sat in bed next to me every night as I would read and try to discuss what I read only for him to be uninterested.  

Finally im finished and I beg him!  ""This book is very insightful, but you need to read it too.  I can't be the only one trying here.""...He rolled his eyes.  He never picked it up.  Years tick by, we are not doing horrible as far as marriages go, but things certainly aren't ideal.  

I continue trying to better myself and do whatever it is I can do for our marriage on my own.  I mean, maybe if im the perfect wife he will just naturally be a better husband.  Well fuck all that.  Here I am, last week he asked me ""If im so horrible than why are you with me"" (well thats a great fucking question I have no good answer for)...Hes got the nerve to ask me why I stick around.  

Here I am for 10 years with at least 6 books on marriage under my belt.  I've done everything and the thought I continuously keep getting, the conclusion I keep making, the position I cannot shake...is that my husband does not give a fuck about me or our marriage.  

I've looked him straight in his eyes while im sobbing and said, ""I feel like you dont love me, im not happy."", for him to gloss over it like nothing, he ignores me and like a goldfish the next morning it's like it never happened.  I bring it up, bc it is important and we didn't address it yesterday and he tells me how I can't ever let anything go.  

Well im done seeing what it is that I can do.  Im so sick of being the only one to give a shit about our marriage.  Is this it?  If I give up I see no way to avoid getting a divorce.  

It drive me crazy pretending such a big part of my life is not making me miserable for the sake of our 10 year old son.  Everyday it's harder and harder to fake.  I just suppress it and pretend nothing is bothering me.  

It's like a cyst or a boil on the part where your butt meets your thigh, it's uncomfortable but its not ready to be lanced yet so you just ignore it, once in a while you sit on it wrong and it hurts and a little fluid leaks out, just enough so it's tolerable again, just enough to take the pressure off.

,Divorce,"I’m sure this is probably a common topic but I’d like to hear people’s thoughts. I’m just getting started wit the process after several years of just generally bad marriage and recently finding some obvious signs of infidelity. STBX denied it but won’t fight it and initially agrees to collaborative process. We have an early elementary age son.  As we begin what have been tense discussions, STBX seems to agree custody should be split 50/50, or at least that the court would force that, but we can’t agree on how that arrangement should work. STBX wants more back and forth and I think some longer stints (5-7 days)  is easier to manage and would avoid the stress of bouncing around every 2-3 days. At least that’s how it would feel if it were me. I guess I would qualify that by saying I think an evening visit and extracurricular activities would allow for some contact for the parent who’s 5-7 day stretch it is. 

I’m not looking to poll who is right. I’d just honestly like to hear how people do their 50/50 arrangements and if they feel it is good or bad for their child. Or if they have a non 50/50 agreement that works, I am interested to hear what that is as well.

,Divorce,"Hi everyone. Couldn’t think of the right title. Wanted to sort of see how you’d handle this situation. 

Background info: 

Divorced, 2 kids. Have had a partner for almost 6 years now who lives with me and my children. Great and healthy relationship. 

My ex-husband recently re-married. New wife has a daughter. 

Live in a high cost living area. Ex pays support but I don’t enforce other things on our legal paperwork (like him paying half of extra curriculars, sports, etc). I also waived his pension (we were married 10 years, and this was against the lawyer’s advice, but I didn’t think it’s right to take a portion of that).
I also agreed that at tax time, we each claim a child, instead of just me claiming both, being that they live with me. Also against advice of everyone, but I do all of this because I try to be kind &amp; I know it’s hard enough where we live. 

I try to do the right thing for the greater good. But...sometimes I think I’m being taken advantage of. 

I’m not sure how ex and new wife manage their finances (and it’s not my business), but my ex is now trying to guilt me about vacations. They go on various trips with her daughter (which is their right and I accept that). But he says it’s because they can’t afford to take all 3 kids on trips. 

I feel like I’m set up to fail in a way. I have a 6th grader and a 3rd grader (who has severe dyslexia and receives various services. He just moved from a small class to inclusion this year  and also regresses quickly, has tutoring 2x a week, etc  - so it’s imperative that he not miss school unless he is ill) and due to this, I’m just not comfortable pulling them from school for vacations. It’s a pain and if one didn’t have a severe learning disability and the other wasn’t a new middle schooler, I’d feel different. 

Ex will ask to pull them from school for a trip and he knows I will say it’s not a good idea. He will then counter and say that if they have to book a trip during school vacations, that I should pay up because it’s more money for them. 

They recently asked if I could give them $1200 for a cruise in the summer that they want to go on. 
He also asked if I could cover a $150 increase on a weekend trip because I didn’t want the kids to be pulled from school for a day (older son had a test). 

He then said this: 

“Let me not pay a child support payment, then I can afford to take my boys on a trip. If you did that.... that will show me you really understand my situation and want me to have the kids come. [I’m] asking you to be nice and help give your kids a nice vacation.”

I feel like I’m being manipulated. He was never good with money. I’m assuming their finances are separate and she has $ to take her daughter on various trips (she seems to always be booking a trip, which is great) and he doesn’t have $ to take his kids too. And I assume he feels guilty and the optics look bad. People have commented on pics of him on vacation with his wife and daughter, asking where his kids were. He has upcoming trip this weekend and again in a week or so, both without his kids.  So in an effort to make me the bad guy, they ask if they can pull the kids out of school and they know I’ll say no. Then ask for $ to accommodate not pulling them from school, which they know I can’t really do. I can’t afford to give $1200 for a cruise. I’m in a no-win situation where I’m the bad guy.

,Divorce,"Sorry it’s a long one, my first time posting, throwaway. Just need to get it out I guess.

Married only a couple of years, but dated since we were kids. No children. Despite what I’ll say here, she’s a very kind and affectionate person, puts others first, supports me. That all changed about a year ago, and I think it’s coming from her depression, I don’t really blame her.  STBXW initiated, then showed regret and asked if I wanted to stay, but after having already done and said so much I don’t know if I can forgive her. 

 Grew apart while I was on military orders, not the first couple to have done so and won’t be the last, but it doesn’t make it any less painful. I feel like I’ve lost everything I’ve wanted and worked for since I was a kid. I don’t know how to feel or what to do. 

My deepest regret is not communicating better while I was away.  Between lack of access to a phone, a crazy and conflicting schedule, and my own shortcomings, it was texting every day but a phone call a week, tops. She deserved better than that. But everything else I did in life I tried to do for us. She became deeply depressed, we began fighting, she started to say it was as if we weren’t even married, and eventually said she wanted a divorce. I was still away, and I begged and pleaded and fought. By the end of the orders, she would frequently tell me she didn’t even want me to come home, that if I did she would leave. These things all still hurt, months later.

When I did get back, nothing was the same. We still got along, still loved each other deeply. But she was vicious, I was walking on eggshells. She’d apologize for treating me so shitty, be open about it coming from a deep resentment from when I was gone, but it wouldn’t change. I never complained, terrified she’d go to a lawyer and start the paperwork the second I did. Every couple of weeks, just when things seemed better, she’d say she wanted a divorce again. I fought it with everything I had, dragged us to counseling, dozens of late night talks. But it seemed the more I tried, the more she doubled down on the harshness. 

I still don’t know if she cheated. I confronted her several times. She always denied it, made me feel crazy for saying anything. I try to tell myself she didn’t. But I’d notice so many things. Stories of drinking alone with dudes while I was gone, only told to me months later. Extensive video calls with a male “friend”, wouldn’t tell me his name, always in another room with the door closed, “it’s my business who I talk to, we’re basically divorced”, catching glimpses of him on the other end shirtless or lying in bed, eventually calls every night. Peaking my head in just to ask what she wants for dinner would start an argument on me not trusting her. Sometimes in her frustration she’d just up and leave and “stay the night at a friends”, which by the end of the marriage was 90% of nights, and I found out it was conveniently almost always at just one “friend’s” house. I was cleaning one day and found drawings of him, with little lovey side notes addressed to him to be sent in a picture. I thought I trusted her. It shattered me. Destroyed anything I thought I knew about her. And I want to trust what she’s told me, to this day. But part of me feels she wouldn’t have even thought she was cheating while I was gone, even while I was back, “basically divorced”. She’d say I was paranoid, stupid, and insecure. 

Eventually, I caved. Filed the paperwork, got the date. I felt like dirt, something treaded underfoot. A complete failure. At first I figured I’d do it for her, it wasn’t fair to drag her through the marriage even if I wanted to stick it out. But eventually, as the snapping and blaming continued, I started to see it for me too.

In my final weeks at the house, she became very affectionate. We had frequent sex. Started asking if I really want to leave, what if we just say screw it, what if we have a baby, what if we split but you still stay? Starts making it seem like it’s my decision to go. Says how about we just throw the packet away? Do you really have to go?

God, what I would’ve given to have heard that, for months. All my dreams come true. Night after night of turmoil, the only thing I wanted in the world was to hear those words. I almost said yes. Tear up the papers, fuck the court date, let’s start a family, praise Jesus.

But I remembered desperate phone calls, begging her to still be there when I got back home. Hours of berating. The drawing, most of all. I said I thought it was best for both of us, and meant it. I didn’t want to say it. I didn’t want to go. 

We still talk, lightly texting, calls now and then. She still says ILY when we hang up. It kills me. I say it back. I mean it. I’m still in love with her. It finalizes soon. Deep down I know that if she hadn’t initiated, we’d still be together, even if everything else was still true. I don’t know if I can still talk to her. I don’t know if I can ever tell her how I feel, if I’ll ever know if she cheated, if I’ll ever believe her answer. I hate that I still have my career. It feels like I sacrificed my marriage to it. I love my job, but dread going to work now. 

I’m trying to move forward, exercise, get back to church. But it’s just so hard, it catches you any time you’re alone. It’s like running into a brick wall, knocking you on your ass and reminding you what you’ve lost. I don’t want to run into any old friends, don’t want to have to explain why I don’t have a ring on. I hate it. I just want to go home, kiss my dogs, hold her tight, never let go. I don’t know who to talk to, what to say. I know I have my whole life ahead of me, plenty of fish, all that bullshit. But right now, it’s hard just to get out of bed. I want to learn from it, be less forgetful and more attentive, and don’t let myself be walked on. I just don’t know what to do. Any advice, anything, even just you managing to read this fuckin novel, is greatly appreciated.",t2_4tczy93d,False,,0,False,"Deeply confused, not sure if I should maintain contact, seeking advice",[],r/Divorce,False,1,,0,False,t3_dj3od0,False,light,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Mental Health/Depression/Loneliness,False,5,,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1571331786.0,text,1,,text,self.Divorce,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry it’s a long one, my first time posting, throwaway. Just need to get it out I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Married only a couple of years, but dated since we were kids. No children. Despite what I’ll say here, she’s a very kind and affectionate person, puts others first, supports me. That all changed about a year ago, and I think it’s coming from her depression, I don’t really blame her.  STBXW initiated, then showed regret and asked if I wanted to stay, but after having already done and said so much I don’t know if I can forgive her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grew apart while I was on military orders, not the first couple to have done so and won’t be the last, but it doesn’t make it any less painful. I feel like I’ve lost everything I’ve wanted and worked for since I was a kid. I don’t know how to feel or what to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My deepest regret is not communicating better while I was away.  Between lack of access to a phone, a crazy and conflicting schedule, and my own shortcomings, it was texting every day but a phone call a week, tops. She deserved better than that. But everything else I did in life I tried to do for us. She became deeply depressed, we began fighting, she started to say it was as if we weren’t even married, and eventually said she wanted a divorce. I was still away, and I begged and pleaded and fought. By the end of the orders, she would frequently tell me she didn’t even want me to come home, that if I did she would leave. These things all still hurt, months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I did get back, nothing was the same. We still got along, still loved each other deeply. But she was vicious, I was walking on eggshells. She’d apologize for treating me so shitty, be open about it coming from a deep resentment from when I was gone, but it wouldn’t change. I never complained, terrified she’d go to a lawyer and start the paperwork the second I did. Every couple of weeks, just when things seemed better, she’d say she wanted a divorce again. I fought it with everything I had, dragged us to counseling, dozens of late night talks. But it seemed the more I tried, the more she doubled down on the harshness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don’t know if she cheated. I confronted her several times. She always denied it, made me feel crazy for saying anything. I try to tell myself she didn’t. But I’d notice so many things. Stories of drinking alone with dudes while I was gone, only told to me months later. Extensive video calls with a male “friend”, wouldn’t tell me his name, always in another room with the door closed, “it’s my business who I talk to, we’re basically divorced”, catching glimpses of him on the other end shirtless or lying in bed, eventually calls every night. Peaking my head in just to ask what she wants for dinner would start an argument on me not trusting her. Sometimes in her frustration she’d just up and leave and “stay the night at a friends”, which by the end of the marriage was 90% of nights, and I found out it was conveniently almost always at just one “friend’s” house. I was cleaning one day and found drawings of him, with little lovey side notes addressed to him to be sent in a picture. I thought I trusted her. It shattered me. Destroyed anything I thought I knew about her. And I want to trust what she’s told me, to this day. But part of me feels she wouldn’t have even thought she was cheating while I was gone, even while I was back, “basically divorced”. She’d say I was paranoid, stupid, and insecure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I caved. Filed the paperwork, got the date. I felt like dirt, something treaded underfoot. A complete failure.

,Divorce,"It will be 10 years since I asked my ex to move out on the 23rd of this month.  Within 2 years, both of my kids (who were 15 and 13 at the time of separation) chose to go no contact with their dad.

 After we separated, the ex bounced from woman to woman,  introducing them to the kids, being engaged to one of them for a few years before she woke up to his abusive and gaslighting ways.  She messaged my kids to let them know she and their dad had split.  Turns out my ex always told her that she was the reason the kids wouldn't go see him anymore. My kids set her straight.

,Divorce,"You may have seen my earlier post about having a potentially broken finger and being upset about having to deal with it by myself. It turns out that the worst case scenario was realized and I have to deal with full-on surgery today, again all alone. It's pretty rough scrambling to find a ride home when there used to be someone who loved you and would take care of you at a time like this. Instead I will be riding home to my empty house with someone who is very nice, but just an acquaintance.

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to this person, but I just feel so sad that there's no one who truly cares for me to make sure I'm alright before and after the operation. It probably wouldn't be so hard if I weren't freshly separated, but the loss of the person who was always at my side hurts more than any broken bone.

Instead I will be riding home to my empty house with someone who is very nice, but just an acquaintance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I&amp;#39;m grateful to this person, but I just feel so sad that there&amp;#39;s no one who truly cares for me to make sure I&amp;#39;m alright before and after the operation.

,Divorce,"Late 20s/early 30s. Married 6 years. One kid. Both military and career minded. 

We've been on rocky terms for a while but have just sorta tollerated each other for the last 2 years. Things aren't bad, but they're not good. About a month ago we had the ""are we gonna get divorced?"" talk and then the topic faded. I actually thought things were getting better. 

Last night, I came home from work and he started off the evening by asking for a divorce and laying out all the reasons why. His reasons, while I disagree with them (I'm terrible at communication), are valid and I feel similarly (*we're* terrible at communication). He spends 90% of his free time playing video games and I feel incredibly alone in my own home. It's something we've fought over our entire marriage. 

Today, he's back peddling pretty hard. He said that what he meant was, he thinks we'll end up divorced if we don't fix something. I pressed him - ""I want a divorce"" is much different than ""I want counseling."" He tells me that he's happy with everything in life  - work, neighborhood, house, pets, kid, etc, except for me. I just want a life partner who's emotionally engaged with me. 

I'm deploying here in about 7 weeks, and we both agreed that nothing sudden needs to happen before I leave. I told him tonight that I need some sort of mental stability heading into my deployment - this trip is not going to be an easy one, and worrying about home is the LAST thing I need. 

Honestly, I was almost relieved when he asked for the divorce. Heartbroken and stunned, but there was an element of relief there, too. 

Financially, we're massively entwined. He wants to stay business partners, just not husband/wife. I'm not on board with that, but I also don't want to rush financial decisions that could damage more than just the two of us (we own rentals together). We share a son. Then there's the military side, which would make custody a freaking nightmare if/when one or both of us gets moved. If it was as simple as moving into an apartment nearby and sharing the kiddo, I'd be almost okay with that. 

Right now, I'm leaning towards keeping things mellow until I deploy, and then moving out when I get back. My husband is a good guy and a good dad, we're just a terrible match.

,Divorce,"M34 married to F38 for 11 years in Ohio. Owe $110,000 on $175,000 home. Four kids. 

I own a small company that made $25k last year and paid me $12k in payroll. She does not work. Near the poverty line for house of 6. 

Yesterday I was doing some book keeping and noticed a business account had been emptied (approx $1500), all but $20. I thought it was fraud but it was actually her. Soon after, the police showed up and told me I had 10-15min to gather my things. 

This isn't the first time she's done this. So I'm better prepared, financially. I have $10k of available credit on high interest credit cards and $2k liquid. The account she drained contained all business deposits, money that isn't actually mine but was paid to us as 50% deposits on projects I'm yet to complete. Before, I had to produce this money through short term loans. 

I'm not innocent. I have some mental deficiencies and struggle with impulse control. I am nearly certain I'm in a lifelong battle with undiagnosed depression that can last weeks/months when it comes on. It manifests in me lashing out at those closest to me. My inability to control my mouth has coat me friends, a job, and now this. 

She is not innocent. Icyness is the best way I can describe her conflict resolution. Any argument had the potential to lead to days or weeks of not talking. Maybe I'm codependent but this is where my depression would kick in and I lose all motivation. This is where my resentment would grow and eventually I'd lose control and say whatever awful things were on my mind. I swear, it's like a form of Tourette's not just a child throwing a temper tantrum. 

I dont know what to do. Before when she pulled this, it was more tramatic. She was pregnant with our youngest and was having an affair (kid is 100% definitely my son) with a coworker when she drained my account and had me removed. Back then, I also didnt have any real money so I didnt get a lawyer. She walked all over me before violating her own protection order and initiating the sequence of events that would see me return to our home. 

My heart is broken for our children. Despite what might sound like an unstable situation, homelife for the kids has been exactly the opposite. We wake up together. We have dinner together. We have a quiet time together 5 of us on a couch cuddled together watching slime videos. We have a nighttime routine with prayers and two songs. It's really been perfect and the kids show it. They are being recognized often in the classroom and with their respective teams. I am terrified for them. I'm the type that will call in bedtime if I'm away and now we have to wait 10days just to get to court much less be together. 

I'm so sad. That doesn't begin to describe it. Lots of dark thoughts. 

What do I do now? Put myself in debt for a lawyer - if so, how much is reasonable? 

What questions do I ask?

Things have been bad for years but she finally told me she wanted a divorce in late May of this year. Tried counseling, nothing. She wants to split. Too much bad history (she's not wrong), no chance to rebuild. Bought a replacement diamond on our anniversary weeks later, like a fool (she'd lost it doing dishes), only to be told that she couldn't wear it. Meaning, to me, this is over. I was devastated for months.

Still living together, the kids don't know, still doing family stuff, vacations, whatever. I eventually stop wearing my ring, when I finally accept that, no, she's gone, and not coming back. She fucking hates not just me, but even the things that I like, that she once did. My enjoyment of something actively precludes her from the same and it crushes me. I go about the work of slowly shutting down how I feel about her, building protection against the constant (and I mean, any chance) onslaught of shitty comments.

About a month or two ago, I told her that we either needed to make the divorce happen now or I'd need to be able to start seeing other people. It's been years without any real sexual relationship to speak of, and about six months without any physical contact. She agrees, we set up some reasonable ground rules, and that's the last we talk about it. I set up a Tinder account and was immediately overcome with a hot flash of raging embarrassment and made my account private as fast as my fingers could. The pressure, however, was relieved. The landscape had changed, and I was slowly starting to have hope in the future.

Cut to Sunday - I went on a long hike with an old friend who I've always been attracted to, and it was amazing. There's potential there, but I'm damaged as fuck and am quite skittish right now. She knows all of this and has been great and so I thought things were looking up. Then I got home.

Now she's wondering if she did the right thing.

NOW.

Now that I've managed to shut everything off, compartmentalize and justify everything, plan how we'll work this out and try to keep the damage to the kids at a minimum... now she wonders if this is a mistake.

I don't think she loves me. I think the idea of me with someone else is the only thing that makes her perceive any value in me. Like she threw me away and didn't care until someone else picked me up.

fuck

I am in such a shitty place rn I could barely keep it together to get the kids up and to school today. Thank god I work from home and none of my coworkers can see me crying. i still love her, i always will, but i don't think i can ever trust her enough to open that part of myself back up

I’m (29F) considering divorcing my husband (29M) - four years married, together for about ten. We have a dog that I love more than life. and a home together. 

He cheated. Messaged girls behind my back as we were dating. I forgave. Messaged a girl trying to meet up with her when we were engaged. I forgave. Finally, he had a brief relationship with a coworker in November of 2016 (around 14-16 months after we got married; just five months after we moved into our house). I chose to TRY and forgive to try to work past it. Spoiler alert: I have just become a resentful, angry version of myself. There’s virtually no trust between us. I am cold &amp; indifferent toward him. He tries to show affection and I’m simply not interested. Our work schedules are very different so I’m already alone most of the time when I’m not at work and through the night, so not much would change in my day-to-day life, except the weekends in which we usually go do things together.

The problem is that when things are good, they’re actually good. We‘re best friends. We have a lot of common interests and when we go out with our friends to dinner or drinks or whatever, we all have a good time.

I am so, so conflicted. I know he has treated me poorly, but he is remorseful for what happened and I know that if we separate, it will be very hard on him.

We have talked about our rocky relationship and he’s aware that I’m on the edge of leaving, and he says he’s already depressed due to this whole situation.

We both want to do a mediated divorce and can agree on splitting assets and responsibilities however she's adamant that she doesn't want to pay child or spousal support.

She seems to think I can ""agree not to take any"" and she'll just cover more expenses and ""help me out"" for a little while.

,Divorce,"I always like when the weather cools off like this.  I’ll never get why my German and Scottish ancestors settled in Texas, but I keep meaning to get out of here.  I think it’s the idea of knowing no one there that keeps me here though.

I’m pretty down today and just wanted to get some stuff out.  I filed in the middle of last month, and my wife of five years took it a little harder than I expected.  I used to describe her anger as that she just felt things louder than everyone else, and other people nodded, but I don’t know if they got it.  I only sometimes got it.  After the second time I had to call the cops I knew that things weren’t getting any safer, and so I needed to get out.  I talked to friends and family.  I prayed, strangely.  I did what anyone reading my life story would have considered inevitable, but felt like uncharted territory for me.

To this day she still hasn’t agreed to sign the waiver that Texas presents as an option, so my attorney is having her served.  We’ve already agreed on how to split things up.  We actually did it last week.  It used to be that one of us(usually her) would get up and leave to stop the discussions.  Well, last Tuesday she lost control of her emotions and totaled her car.  She is okay.  The airbag deployed and the seatbelt gave her a bruise just like one I saw on a bull rider once when I was a little boy, but she is okay.

I was the only one she called to help and I was there just few minutes after the wreck.  I talked to the EMTs, cops, wrecker and whoever else came by that I may have forgotten.  I cut my hands a little getting some of  her stuff out of her car and into mine.

Then I drove her to the hospital.  I didn’t want to have a fight, like we often do, so I stayed quiet and played John Denver songs while I drove.  I waited in the room with her, and then outside, alternating as my emotions would allow.  She had been texting me, angrily, while I was at work when it happened.  I didn’t want a fight.  I filed for divorce because I’m tired of fighting all the time.  The last thing I sent before her wreck was “I really don’t ever want you to hurt.  You’re a good person and I admire a lot about you.  I know that you’ll come through the other side of this with less uncertainty and pain in your life.”

When we were at the hospital she tried to blame me for the wreck and I was so tired that I pretty much just refused to engage in the issue.  Then we discussed how to divide things up and how to move forward.  I dropped her off at home and then crashed at a friend’s place for most of the following week.

That brings us to today.  This morning was the first time I woke up at our place.  I crashed on the couch last night.  I got a good night’s sleep and this morning we had breakfast together.  I made us coffee and oatmeal like nothing was wrong and we discussed our plans for the day.

I don’t know why I feel so brutally lonely at work now.  I think some of it is just missing the girl that I married five years ago.  Not feeling ready to discuss my past with someone new, but wanting to share my life(weird expression) with someone else.

I don’t really know what I want down the line, but I know that I have it a lot better than most other people out there.  I just want comfortable downtime.  I want that girl who will watch tv in the evening with me and wake me up to go to bed when she see that I feel asleep because I’ve been pushing myself too hard.  I want to remember what snacks some girl likes for road trips or spot when someone tells a joke she knows will hit the perfect mark.  I want all of those things with someone who doesn’t feel anger loudly.  Some girl who has never grabbed a gun because she was mad or screamed at me because she was angry at someone else.

I don’t want to unload all of this on some girl who doesn’t deserve it.  I know that I’m basically a “fixer upper” of a man, rough around the edges, but easily improved.  I’m just not sure where to go from here.

But these are decisions I’ll make on my own.

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty down today and just wanted to get some stuff out.  I filed in the middle of last month, and my wife of five years took it a little harder than I expected.  I used to describe her anger as that she just felt things louder than everyone else, and other people nodded, but I don’t know if they got it.  I only sometimes got it.  After the second time I had to call the cops I knew that things weren’t getting any safer, and so I needed to get out.  I talked to friends and family.  I prayed, strangely.  I did what anyone reading my life story would have considered inevitable, but felt like uncharted territory for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day she still hasn’t agreed to sign the waiver that Texas presents as an option, so my attorney is having her served.  We’ve already agreed on how to split things up.  We actually did it last week.  It used to be that one of us(usually her) would get up and leave to stop the discussions.  Well, last Tuesday she lost control of her emotions and totaled her car.  She is okay.  The airbag deployed and the seatbelt gave her a bruise just like one I saw on a bull rider once when I was a little boy, but she is okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the only one she called to help and I was there just few minutes after the wreck.  I talked to the EMTs, cops, wrecker and whoever else came by that I may have forgotten.  I cut my hands a little getting some of  her stuff out of her car and into mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I drove her to the hospital.  I didn’t want to have a fight, like we often do, so I stayed quiet and played John Denver songs while I drove.  I waited in the room with her, and then outside, alternating as my emotions would allow.  She had been texting me, angrily, while I was at work when it happened.  I didn’t want a fight.  I filed for divorce because I’m tired of fighting all the time.  The last thing I sent before her wreck was “I really don’t ever want you to hurt.  You’re a good person and I admire a lot about you.  I know that you’ll come through the other side of this with less uncertainty and pain in your life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were at the hospital she tried to blame me for the wreck and I was so tired that I pretty much just refused to engage in the issue.  Then we discussed how to divide things up and how to move forward.  I dropped her off at home and then crashed at a friend’s place for most of the following week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings us to today.  This morning was the first time I woke up at our place.  I crashed on the couch last night.  I got a good night’s sleep and this morning we had breakfast together.  I made us coffee and oatmeal like nothing was wrong and we discussed our plans for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why I feel so brutally lonely at work now.  I think some of it is just missing the girl that I married five years ago.  Not feeling ready to discuss my past with someone new, but wanting to share my life(weird expression) with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really know what I want down the line, but I know that I have it a lot better than most other people out there.  I just want comfortable downtime.  I want that girl who will watch tv in the evening with me and wake me up to go to bed when she see that I feel asleep because I’ve been pushing myself too hard.  I want to remember what snacks some girl likes for road trips or spot when someone tells a joke she knows will hit the perfect mark.  I want all of those things with someone who doesn’t feel anger loudly.  Some girl who has never grabbed a gun because she was mad or screamed at me because she was angry at someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to unload all of this on some girl who doesn’t deserve it.  I know that I’m basically a “fixer upper” of a man, rough around the edges, but easily improved.  I’m just not sure where to go from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these are decisions I’ll make on my own.  I want to go out and enjoy this gorgeous weather, but I think I’ll have to do that in my own.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Hello,

I don't want to share too much on my first post, but I'm hoping to get some advice and be pointed in the right direction.

My wife and I are going to get divorced.  Initially I did not want to, but as time has passed I realized how toxic our relationship was for the both of us.  We have a 2 year old child, and own a house together.

I thought we were on the same page together and could take care of things through mediation, but recently she expressed the desire to have a majority of physical custody of our child AND move about 2 hours away from me because she says she cannot afford to live near me. I'm not in a rich neighborhood by any means, but she is not willing to live in an apartment or condo and acts like she must own a house. I was prepared to buy out the house we own together using funds I have that are separate from our marriage, in lieu of us selling it and both having to eat the realtor's cut, but I don't really want to do that if my kid is not going to live with me. It'd be a big empty place.  Due to that, and the fact that she started throwing around the term ""primary caregiver"", and that she now seems to feel it'll be in our child's best interest to move, I feel it's time for me to ""lawyer up"" as they say.

I've never needed a lawyer in my life, so I don't know how to find one, how paying them works, etc. I want one that will give me my options and help me protect myself, but I don't want one that will be TOO aggressive on my part.  (My parents had that when they got divorced and it was bad, they ended up firing the overly aggressive lawyer.)

To make it more complicated, we both work at home and I don't feel I could have a ""private"" conversation over the phone at home.

How would I go about finding a lawyer? Do I ""interview"" multiple ones as some sites seem to suggest, or is that seen as a negative thing? How does paying them usually work, like per visit or case or hours  -- and is it upfront? Do I call them? What do I say?

All I really want is for things to be fair, and what's best for our child. I have some ideas of things I'd like to try/offer, but since some of them involve money I think it'd make sense to get real advice first. I've been very passive in the past, but 2019 has become the year that I've started to stand up for myself and I'm not willing to be walked all over anymore.

,Divorce,"So this is my first time posting on any kind of thing online like this just started reading post an downloaded this app 10 minutes ago it will b a long story lol.. Just finalized our divorce about 2 weeks ago still have another hearing for custody soon to come. My relationship started about 6 years ago we were both young. We had both had our fair share of sexual partners before we got together in all reality. We were together about a year and a half when she found that she was pregnant! At first i was scared to death we lived together going back an fourth between our parents houses. I didnt think i was ready to be a dad, didnt think i could step up to the plate an be a great provider and role model. I soon got a decent paying job an we bought a trailer from her family. Our new home was far from perfect but we had months to get it ready for our coming daughter. I worked full time she did part time even being pregnant every day after work we would do as much as we could to get our new home prepared. We got it looking amazing really turned it to a home and brought our baby girl home. The moment i first saw my baby girl still feels like yesterday four years later, it changed my hole world! I knew everything would be different and i would do anything i possibly could for my baby as soon as first layed eyes on her. Everything was going great we were both so proud of our new home and our precese baby girl. It all changed for the first time about two months after we brought our baby girl home. I was at work and came home to have my kids mom/girlfriend say an old friend drove by the house an saw her outside an stopped to say hi. I really didnt think anything of it. About a week after seeing this ""old friend"" again one night she ask if id be ok with her going over to his house for a little party he was having with all her friends there. I'll admit i was kinda hesitant saying yeah its cool go to his house while id stayed home with our daughter none the less i did trust her and agreed itd be ok as long as she wasn't gone all night. She came back home a couple hours no big deal. It soon became more frequent and more suspicious. I started to lose my trust in her. One morning before i went to work she had been out all night and not gotten home till about 7 a.m. i layed awake all night in tears playing out all these situations and had myself convinced she had been lying and started cheating. So before i left for work i picked up her phone an started snooping all my worst fears were proven more then true. She moved i with him when our baby was about 4 months old. It was beyond heart breaking. As months passed I sold our home back to her family as they sold it to us very low price as a strated for US to build and begin a family. After 4, or 5 months her new relationship had ended she ran back to me explaining she had made the biggest mistake and left him in hopes of restoring a family. It took me about a week of her text an visits everyday to take her back an try to make our relationship work.  Everything was back to as normal as could be for 5 months or so. I had been working long hours and when i got home just had a horrible feeling as soon as i walked in the door. Shortly after i got home she said she was going to go out with a girlfriend just by her attitude an my gut feeling i knew she was lying. When her girlfriend got there to pick her up i walked outside with her against her wishes. Not to my surprise it was the ""old friend"" again. I broke down and begged her not to go with him. She jumped in his truck an was gone. After a few hours i got a call from her crying saying she didnt know what she was thinking and asking me to pick her up from her grandmas where he dropped her off. I went and picked her up and brought her home. After a few months back together we found out she was pregnant and would have our second daughter. We made it a little over a year before the same cycle played out with a different guy. I took her back again after it didnt work out for her with him. Though all the good times we had talked about marriage. I explained to her i really would love to call her my wife and spend the rest of my life with her, but i was scared to death to marry her and then have the same cycle repeat again after we said our vows she swore on everything she had learned from her mistakes. She would never give up her family an repeat the same mistakes again she would stay faithful and be the best wife possible. I went to my mom and got a ring passed down through generations originally from my great grandmother. I ask her to marry me. My grandpap got certified as an ordained minister to be the one to marry us. We had a beautiful wedding and said our vows to become man and wife. It took two weeks after the day we were wed and she started staying out all night leaving me home to care of our babies after working 12 hour days. Soon it was to the point she wouldn't even be home to care for the girls when i had to leave for work, i would have to get them out of bed and take them to my moms an leave for work. She picked up all her clothes and things while i was working and the girls were at my moms. She had very little contact with them for months at a time. Once it didnt work out with the man she moved in with less then a month after we made our vows she tried to play the same game an excepted me to take her back like nothing happened once again. It literally took all of my willpower to stand my ground an not take her back. Marriage meant a good deal to me i grew up in church and took those vows made to god and all the family and friends present extremely serious. After she took our marriage as such a joke an cheated within two weeks i knew i wouldn't be able to just move past it and forced myself to not just let her come back like she just took a vacation and done no wrong. Even tho i told her i wouldn't just take her back with open arms this time, i still let her stay over a couple nights a week. Her staying over lasted a couple weeks and she found a new guy and shortly have became pregnant with his child. On what would've been our 1 year anniversary she filed for divorce. Its been about a year and eight months scents we said i do. Even to this day whenever she has a fight with the new babby daddy or he starts cheating on her! She starts all her games on me again, telling me how none of these other guys have ever compared to the love and relationship we had and how she'd never repeat the cycle again, how sorry she is, an how bad she wants our marriage and family back together. Even after all of it i still have an unreasonably hard time telling her i can't do it i cant take her back and keep going through these same things. I still love her to the point it hurts even wrighting this. I replay events in my head and wonder if I'd done somethings differently if she would've stayed faithful. I pick apart our past conversations and everyday just trying to put blame on myself. As if maybe if i got her flowers more often or done more spontaneous date nights or just anything i could have done to make her want to stay. While we were together anything she ask id jump an do my best to do anything she wanted. She hasn't had a job for years now, and while we where together or she'd stay over after problems in her relationship id work 10 or 12 hours and still come home to her sitting there and id clean the house make dinner rub her feet and back an legit cater to her every want in the few hours i had before bed to get ready to go back to work. I try to put all my focus on my baby girls we have a court ordered time secdule with them after our last hearing. I try to take my daughter's to do something every day i have off work weather it be just go to the local parks a few hours or push them on there swing set in my backyard go on train rides an anything kids would enjoy in our area. The past year and change i would take them to my moms almost every morning an pick them up the second i got off work. For a good while she just didnt act like she had any available time for our daughter's. About the time she filed for divorce i moved a couple county's away from her back to where i grew up. I once again own my own home recently got a nice newer vehicle honestly even kinda happy with my job like my co workers and dont dread getting up to go in.. I've always been the type to just keep it all in check not let my emotions control my actions an never really vent my problems to any family or friend. You'd think with all i have going good for me I'd be in a great place and anyone that knows me would tell you im an upbeat happy person. I just wish i truly felt the way anyone not in my head thinks i do. It still kills me everyday i want her back so bad. I want to hate her for the things shes done an put me an my girls through really. But i cant and i honestly don't kno why i still love her at all let alone as much as i really do. Ive had one, one night stand in the past year and 8 months. Im a 25 year old guy an before my ex wife id slept with about 30 different women so its not that i havent been with anyone because im not good looking or cant get a girl. I just don't even try to talk to any women dont try to start a new relationship the three nights a week that my daughter's stay at there moms i get off work and sit at my house alone an not even talk to anyone. I wish i could move on as easily as she always has an not just act like none of it bothers me but have it actually not bother me to the point at times its unbearable.

I went to my mom and got a ring passed down through generations originally from my great grandmother. I ask her to marry me. My grandpap got certified as an ordained minister to be the one to marry us. We had a beautiful wedding and said our vows to become man and wife. It took two weeks after the day we were wed and she started staying out all night leaving me home to care of our babies after working 12 hour days. Soon it was to the point she wouldn&amp;#39;t even be home to care for the girls when i had to leave for work, i would have to get them out of bed and take them to my moms an leave for work. She picked up all her clothes and things while i was working and the girls were at my moms. She had very little contact with them for months at a time. Once it didnt work out with the man she moved in with less then a month after we made our vows she tried to play the same game an excepted me to take her back like nothing happened once again. It literally took all of my willpower to stand my ground an not take her back. Marriage meant a good deal to me i grew up in church and took those vows made to god and all the family and friends present extremely serious. After she took our marriage as such a joke an cheated within two weeks i knew i wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to just move past it and forced myself to not just let her come back like she just took a vacation and done no wrong. Even tho i told her i wouldn&amp;#39;t just take her back with open arms this time, i still let her stay over a couple nights a week. Her staying over lasted a couple weeks and she found a new guy and shortly have became pregnant with his child. On what would&amp;#39;ve been our 1 year anniversary she filed for divorce. Its been about a year and eight months scents we said i do. Even to this day whenever she has a fight with the new babby daddy or he starts cheating on her! She starts all her games on me again, telling me how none of these other guys have ever compared to the love and relationship we had and how she&amp;#39;d never repeat the cycle again, how sorry she is, an how bad she wants our marriage and family back together. Even after all of it i still have an unreasonably hard time telling her i can&amp;#39;t do it i cant take her back and keep going through these same things. I still love her to the point it hurts even wrighting this. I replay events in my head and wonder if I&amp;#39;d done somethings differently if she would&amp;#39;ve stayed faithful. I pick apart our past conversations and everyday just trying to put blame on myself. As if maybe if i got her flowers more often or done more spontaneous date nights or just anything i could have done to make her want to stay. While we were together anything she ask id jump an do my best to do anything she wanted. She hasn&amp;#39;t had a job for years now, and while we where together or she&amp;#39;d stay over after problems in her relationship id work 10 or 12 hours and still come home to her sitting there and id clean the house make dinner rub her feet and back an legit cater to her every want in the few hours i had before bed to get ready to go back to work. I try to put all my focus on my baby girls we have a court ordered time secdule with them after our last hearing. I try to take my daughter&amp;#39;s to do something every day i have off work weather it be just go to the local parks a few hours or push them on there swing set in my backyard go on train rides an anything kids would enjoy in our area. The past year and change i would take them to my moms almost every morning an pick them up the second i got off work. For a good while she just didnt act like she had any available time for our daughter&amp;#39;s. About the time she filed for divorce i moved a couple county&amp;#39;s away from her back to where i grew up. I once again own my own home recently got a nice newer vehicle honestly even kinda happy with my job like my co workers and dont dread getting up to go in.. I&amp;#39;ve always been the type to just keep it all in check not let my emotions control my actions an never really vent my problems to any family or friend. You&amp;#39;d think with all i have going good for me I&amp;#39;d be in a great place and anyone that knows me would tell you im an upbeat happy person. I just wish i truly felt the way anyone not in my head thinks i do. It still kills me everyday i want her back so bad. I want to hate her for the things shes done an put me an my girls through really. But i cant and i honestly don&amp;#39;t kno why i still love her at all let alone as much as i really do. Ive had one, one night stand in the past year and 8 months. Im a 25 year old guy an before my ex wife id slept with about 30 different women so its not that i havent been with anyone because im not good looking or cant get a girl. I just don&amp;#39;t even try to talk to any women dont try to start a new relationship the three nights a week that my daughter&amp;#39;s stay at there moms i get off work and sit at my house alone an not even talk to anyone. I wish i could move on as easily as she always has an not just act like none of it bothers me but have it actually not bother me to the point at times its unbearable. Don&amp;#39;t really want anyones simpithy if you took the time to read threw i appreciate you taking your time on my story.. Good luck to all of you on this divorce page i truly feel your pain and kno every bit of how difficult it is to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Quick background. My (M47) STBXW (F45) said she was unhappy almost 2 years ago, so we ""worked"" on things. Turns out she was having an emotional affair with someone else. Six months later, it finally turned physical and she said she wanted a divorce. I wasn't going to give up, told her I forgave her and wanted to try and salvage our marriage and family. She left the AP (over the course of a month or so), began couples therapy again after about three or four months, things seemed to be going good. That didn't last very long though, and she eventually just gave up. We separated six months ago. 

Normally, I don't worry about inviting her to things on my weekends because she is in the next state over visiting her stupid boyfriend (of four months, not the AP) or her stupid next-state-over boyfriend is here. This weekend however is different. She just finished a week long vacation with her stupid next-state-over boyfriend and is home this weekend. 

I've gone through the shattering phase, the withdrawal phase, the internalizing phase, and am currently in the rage phase. Where before I wanted to work things out and truly did forgive her, now I'm just pissed off at her for what she did and who she is. I can't stand the thought of her. 

However, my two kids (between 7 &amp; 9 yrs old) - especially my daughter - still wants to do things as a family. We're talking about trick-or-treating together and maybe spending Christmas morning together. 

This weekend I was thinking of taking my kids to the pumpkin patch. My STBXW is in town due to the week long vacation she just got back from (I assume). I am thinking I should invite her to the pumpkin patch for my kid's sake (also maybe for good will as we're still working out details about the divorce), but I can't stand her right now. If I do invite her, I'm not going to start any fights or anything like that, I'll mostly just not talk to her - especially when the kids aren't around. That's basically how I don't start fights, I just don't look at or talk to her.  

I guess my question is... should I invite her for my kid's sake? Do other people invite their EX or STBX to things because they know it will make their children happy?

,Divorce,"I'm a 45 year old man entering divorce after 21 years of marriage.  Earlier this year, my 3 kids (youngest is 19) approached me with evidence that my STBX had been cheating.  Long story short one of them obtained screen shots of her messages sending racy texts and pics to a guy at her work.  I guess all the signs have been there for a while and I can honestly say, I emotionally started distancing myself a while back.  However, I was absolutely floored.  When I confronted her, she was super apologetic and became super wife so I agreed to reconcile.  However, I couldn't really get past it.  Fast forward a couple of months and she started going out every night.  I wasn't happy with this and noticed she was going out night after night and not spending any money.  In other words, who's buying the food and drinks?  She was the bill payer so I started snooping into our finances and discovered an astronomical credit card debt of over $50K (some cards had even been taken out in my name). Our combined income is probably in the top 5-10% so this was ridiculous. That was the final straw and I decided it was over.  When I confronted her there was drama for a couple of months and then she finally agreed it was necessary.  Since the kids are all adults and her debt pretty much wiped out most of the equity in our house, there isn't much to haggle over (other than alimony) so we agreed to settle amicably and go with a dissolution.

However, here is the issue.  We've listed our house for sale but being late in the year, its going slow.  So we're coexisting under the same roof.

Every time I think I'm making progress, she'll send me a flirtatious text or sexy pic and my codependent butt is drawn back in.  For the past few years I secretly fantasized about being alone.  However, I was nott truly prepared for how lonely I now feel.  She's obviously moved on pretty quickly. I'm still stuck in limbo. Bearing witness to her moving on makes it 100x worse.  To complicate matters, for the most part, she was my social life.  All of my friends are married and have been very supportive.  However, I don't always want to be the 3rd wheel so only make plans when they initiate.  So how does one get a social life starting from scratch?

,Divorce,"I don't want to really give any information on this read (it's LONG) but I'm looking for peoples opinions on what's written. I've tried to remove any identifying markers, this includes, gender, location and any other identifying words and I have noted where they've been changed.   


In response to OTHER PERSONS declaration dated DATE, I, AUTHOR, submit the following:

OTHER PERSON is asking for a modification of the transportation arrangements based on THEM moving to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY, sometime in the past several months. OTHER PERSON lived in CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY immediately after going through mediation back in March of 2017. When THEY went through mediation, THEY was well aware that THEY was going to be permanently living in CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY, and signed the CR2A agreement willingingly. THEIR claim that when THEY signed the CR2A THEIR drive was “20 minutes” from CLOSER CITY, while true, is irrelevant, because THEY already had plans to move to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY with THEIR now-SPOUSE, then-LOVER, and the proof is there, in that within just a month or 2 of mediation, THEY did move to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY. It had to already be in the works, or at least being considered, when THEY signed the CR2A. Ever since that day, THEY has been relentlessly trying to hound me, while shirking THEIR responsibilities, and bully me into changing the residential schedule to be something convenient for THEM, with no regard for the amount of time THEY is or is not spending with our children. After all of the complaining and bullying, which included parading THEIR LOVER/SPOUSE and newborn illegitimate CHILD in front of me every chance THEY got, THEY finally moved to A CITY 15 MILES AWAY in the summer of 2018. I thought our fighting was *finally* over. THEY lied under oath in front of a Commissioner in a related matter in which THEY was yet again trying to change the parenting plan, again fighting for less time with our children. THEY told the Commissioner (this is all recorded with the court on video/audio) that THEY didn’t “know anything” about any house in A CITY 15 MILES AWAY, and that THEIR case relied on the fact that THEY lived in CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY. While THEY was saying that exact thing, THEY was simulaneously preparing to move into the house in A CITY 15 MILES AWAY. THEY lived in A CITY 15 MILES AWAY for almost all of the 2018-2019 school year, and things were going fine with the residential schedule, transportation, etc. I thought, “thank goodness, now maybe we can both move on and stop fighting over the residential schedule!” Sometime in the spring or summer of 2019, for some unknown reason, THEY bought, and moved into, a brand new house in CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY again! THEY had already lived the life that THEY said was “unliveable” with our current residential schedule, and with THEIR current work schedule, and yet with no regard for THEIR relationship with our children at all, THEY moved right back into that same situation again, even though THEY works in CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY now, and worked in CLOSER CITY before that. THEY lives in CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY, again. And now, THEY’RE trying to use the transportation arrangements to bully me into changing the residential schedule to be exactly what THEY wants - less time with our children. 

In addition, OTHER PERSON uses THEIR work schedule as one of the many “reasons” (excuses) that THEY cannot abide by the residential schedule and transportation. This is bogus because THEY changed jobs in December 2018, to a job with MAJOR COMPANY, in CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY. Before that, THEY had a perfectly fine job with SMALL COMPANY in CLOSER CITY, making plenty of money. Even though MAJOR COMPANY has offices on the eastside, THEY for some strange reason works in CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY. THEY knew full well when THEY took a job in CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY what that would mean as far as the residential schedule goes, and yet THEY changed jobs anyway. So, when the kids get out of school at 3:50, and off the bus at 4:05, THEY is right across the HWY bridge in CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY, not in CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY. For some ridiculous reason, THEY opts to have a babysitter pick the children up at 4pm and drive them all the way up to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY in the worst traffic of the day, and then complains about the “2+ hour commute” but then neglects to say why THEY won’t use the carpool/express lanes. I have suggested many ways for THEM to keep THEIR schedule with the kids, avoid childcare costs, and cease all of our fighting, but THEY will not budge. As it stands right now, THEY is trying to get away with charging me for over 4 hours each day for childcare, because the babysitter commutes in the heaviest traffic of the day to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY, and then keeps watching the kids until OTHER PERSON also finishes THEIR commute, at 8pm! I don’t understand why THEY can’t do the commute with the kids instead of hiring someone to do it. At least then the kids would have extra time to spend chatting and bonding with their PARENT. But no - THEY can’t be bothered to do that. THEY refuses to consider even one of my ideas, and yet gives no explanation as to why the ideas are not acceptable to THEM. Keep in mind, we are talking about 2 weekends per month, which means 2 Thursday afternoons, 2 Friday mornings, 2 Friday afternoons, and 2 Monday mornings. Some of my ideas have been (this is not an exhaustive list, by any means): 

* Have a sitter pick the kids up from school, which is very close - walking distance - to both a park with a playground and a public library that is open until 8pm, then THEY can drive to the park/library after work and pick them up from there. The sitter would need to be with the children for maybe 2 hours or so, which is completely normal for after school childcare. 
* Have a sitter pick the kids up from school and drive the children to CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY to meet THEM somewhere closer to THEIR work. Again, this would be very convenient for THEM, and would mean that a sitter only watches the kids for a couple of hours a few times per month.
* THEY can get off work early 4 days per month to pick the kids up THEMself, avoiding childcare costs, and make up the hours on other days/evenings or weekends. If THEY needs to make them up at all, which is doubtful. All of the large INDUSTRY firms are extremely flexible with hours, especially if the reason is taking care of their children. I don’t see any reason THEY can’t be bothered to get to work a little bit late for THEIR children. Again, THEY has to commute to CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY for work anyway, so it would be fairly simple for THEM to travel down I-405 instead of I-5 to drop THEIR kids off at school. Instead, THEY wants to make me drive to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY, for some unknown reason. Except I know the reason - THEY is trying to bully me into changing the residential schedule to be what THEY wants - just 48 hours twice per month - using the transportation clause as the reason/excuse. THEY has repeatedly asked for the residential schedule to be changed to Friday at 8pm to Sunday at 8pm, and THEY'RE upset that I won’t just let THEM ignore our children until it’s convenient for THEM.
* For the morning commute to take the kids to school, THEY can drop the kids off on THEIR way to work, like most parents have to do. While this means that 4 days per month THEY will get to work about an hour later than normal (if, in fact, THEY is not also lying about the time THEY normally gets to work), I think in order to spend more time with THEIR children, that is a sacrifice THEY should be willing to make.

OTHER PERSON is asking for the residential schedule to be modified to suit THEIR ideal situation for having moved to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY, again. As you are well aware, the residential schedule is not something that is required to be arbitrated, and thus any changes in schedule THEY is asking for should be ignored. If THEY wants the schedule changed, THEY has other means to go about that, and I am happy to explain to a Commissioner how hard THEY has pushed to spend less and less time with THEIR children, shoving them off on babysitters to commute with, instead of taking that commute time as an opportunity to bond with the children, all because the residential schedule is not THEIR ideal schedule is THEIR ideal world. What matters to me is what’s ideal for the children, not what is ideal to THEM. The children already ask me every so often why  THEY  can’t see their PARENT more, and if anything messes with the schedule at all,  THEY  cry and try to hide it from me, silently suffering on their own. I try to comfort them, but as  THEY  are getting older,  THEY  would rather I not know that  THEY  are crying. I have covered up OTHER PERSON’s desire to spend less time with them, and I try very hard not to involve them in OTHER PERSON’s violations of the parenting plan unless I absolutely have to.

OTHER PERSON claims that THEY is “burdened” with 100% of the driving, but THEY does none of the driving THEMself - THEY hires someone to do it for THEM, and expects me to pay for my share of that “childcare” since THEY is too lazy to do it THEMself. I do not agree that THEIR only option, or even a fair option, is to hire someone to do driving for THEM, when THEY is in CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY when the kids get out of school, but THEY has the babysitter drive the kids for over an hour to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY instead. According to THEM, it’s even “2+ hours” but I doubt the legitimacy of that estimate, given the ability to use carpool/express lanes most of the way up FREEWAY.

The reason OTHER PERSON was “burdened” with 100% of the driving in the first place, which was agreed to by OTHER PERSON in mediation by your firm \[...\], was to minimize or negate the need for OTHER PERSON and I to come in physical contact or close proximity. The only reason I was physically at the exchanges THEY points to, was because it was summertime. All exchanges other than that were during school time, so of course I wasn’t physically present since THEY is supposed to pick them up at school or from the bus stop. The summer before, it’s true that I was not at exchanges because it was emotionally too difficult for me to come into contact with THEIR LOVER, now SPOUSE, and I knew THEIR SPOUSE was the one transporting the children (and this was verified by the babysitter I hired to go get the children for me). The divorce was still very much pending, and THEIR abandoning me and the family was all still very new. I had learned that OTHER PERSON had repeatedly cheated on me during both our engagement and our marriage, and I was still coming to terms with what THEY had stolen from me, in terms of my ability to trust anyone ever again, and to live a normal life. That is the only reason I wasn’t at any exchanges personally that summer - the difficult emotional situation that it was. The following year - summer 2018 - I was in a much better place, and therefore did the summertime exchanges myself, as I at that time had no reason to be fearful of them trapping me into some kind of false claims of stalking. That unfortunately is no longer the truth. Furthermore, OTHER PERSON and THEIR SPOUSE have repeatedly gone out of their way to get me into legal trouble, and then point the finger at me, as if I am the only one to blame. As I’ve told OTHER PERSON several times, you can’t poke someone with a pointy stick over and over and over again and expect not to get poked back. THEY sent THEIR LOVER to deliver divorce papers to me personally, while the kids were right there, and then used that instance in THEIR SPOUSES “harrassment” claims, saying that I was trying to get my dog to attack THEIR SPOUSE. My dog has never attacked anyone, nor would THEY if I’m standing right there. I didn’t even know it was THEIR SPOUSE at the door until I opened it. THEIR claim that I “assaulted” THEIR SPOUSE is false, and the case is still pending with King County courts, but will be dismissed next month. OTHER PERSON and THEIR SPOUSE have repeatedly said  THEY  are “scared” of me, and THEIR SPOUSE has tried - unsuccessfully, multiple times - to get a restraining order against me for “stalking” and “harrassment” which a judge practically laughed in OTHER PERSON’s face about in court, saying essentially that THEY doesn’t believe that either of them are scared of me. Also, every piece of evidence  THEY  brought forth, was thrown out and not considered, except for possibly only 2 pieces out of more than 100, and even those 2 the judge said did not rise to the level of “stalking” or “harrassment.” So after literally years of being battered, bruised (literally in some cases), abused, and bullied by both OTHER PERSON and THEIR SPOUSE, I am completely unwilling to exchange the children in such a way that requires me to be anywhere near either THEM or THEIR SPOUSE.  THEY  created this situation of me being afraid to come near them for fear of being sued or taken to court on frivilous and false charges, which I can ill-afford to pay for representation for, and now THEY wants me to come face to face with THEM every 2 weeks?? The reason the exchange point was chosen to be the children’s school was because neither of us would have to come into contact with one another and have the children witness that animosity and awkwardness. 

OTHER PERSON claims “Since we agreed to this plan in mediation, we have had many difficulties agreeing to anything that is necessary for the parenting plan to basically function.” This is untrue. Except for THEIR inability to find appropriate childcare, which caused THEM to violate the plan numerous times, the parenting plan and residential schedule were running just fine. THEY is just tired of having to find childcare, and also won’t take it upon THEMself to actually pick up THEIR children and do the commute with them, getting to bond with them in the process.  THEY  are 10 years old, and quickly approaching the time when a relationship with the PARENT-figure in their life is going to be exceptionally important, and OTHER PERSON refuses to acknowledge this.

OTHER PERSON claims that “agreements” for me to watch the children for “emergencies” like childbirth have “largely been unsuccessful.” Again, this is bogus, because “childbirth” is something that is known for almost 9 months, and “emergency” childcare can be put in place in many, many ways. THEIR SPOUSE has family in the area. THEY could have made arrangements with sitters through Care.com, UrbanSitter.com, etc., but instead - for THEIR first baby THEY just simply did not pick up the children and expected me to just pick up THEIR slack in not finding appropriate childcare; for THEIR second baby just a year later, I in fact did make agree to make arrangements to keep the kids during spring break, during which THEY was scheduled to give birth, in lieu of THEM being responsible and finding appropriate childcare in the 9 months THEY had to prepare, just so that I could have solid plans instead of THEM dropping the kids in my lap at the last minute again. And after I generously agreed to watch the kids for THEM during spring break, at added expense to myself, THEY didn’t even have the baby during that period of time, nor did OTHER PERSON offer to help with any added food expenses, etc. In contrast, when I fell down a flight of concrete stairs in last winter’s huge snowstorms, and the ER doctor put me on strong pain medications and muscle relaxers, and my car was buried under 2 feet of snow, OTHER PERSON abandoned the kids at a drop-off childcare place and said if I didn’t get the kids, THEY was going to call CPS on me. I couldn’t take care of myself. I was being helped to/from the bathroom and in/out of bed by my PARTNER, who was caring for me at THEIR apartment at the time. I couldn’t eat solid foods as my jaw was broken. I had a broken finger. If this isn’t a truly unforeseen “emergency,” I don’t know what is. And yet, OTHER PERSON had zero consideration for the fact that I couldn’t drive, there was 2 feet of snow on the ground, roads were icy, and I couldn’t even care for myself, let alone my kids or my dog, and said THEY would call CPS if I didn’t get the kids from the dropoff childcare place THEY abandoned my kids at. Another friend of mine graciously picked up my dog the night of my fall and cared for THEM for a week while I was recuperating, while my children literally had to fend for themselves in my house, eating nothing but junk food and playing video games all day, because I literally could not get out of bed without being in immense pain, even on pain medications and muscle relaxers. OTHER PERSON had 9 months to prepare for THEIR “emergency.”

OTHER PERSON claims that I took THEM to court for contempt because THEY missed 2 visits last year. This is blatantly false. I wanted to do just that, but my attorney said in order to be successful in court, I would have to show more than just 2 occurrences of THEM ignoring the residential schedule. So I did. The Commissioner hearing the case agreed, and chided THEM publicly in court, saying that residential time is not a “right” but “is a responsitility,” and “in fact, some would call it a privilege.” She would not have ruled that THEY violated the plan, and also gave THEM Knight’s warnings, if THEY had only violated the plan on 2 occassions. It was several more than that. The Commissioner ruled also that OTHER PERSON had to pay my attorney’s fees and sanctions, but OTHER PERSON never completely paid - THEY deducted the sanctions, because THEY knew I wouldn’t go back to court over $100. OTHER PERSON constantly distorts the truth under oath, as THEY has in THEIR declaration in this instance. OTHER PERSON asked for a review of the Commissioner’s decision by a judge, costing me further attorney’s fees which I could not recoop, and that judge did not overrule the Commissioner, nor did she say I had to give OTHER PERSON back attorney’s fees and sanctions. She in fact rule that OTHER PERSON needed to pay the full sanctions - including the missing $100 - but THEY never did.

OTHER PERSON claims that I retract my end of temporary agreements frequently. This is not true. The only time I have ever done that is when THEIR end of that agreement was also not held up, and thus I did not hold mine up, either. Just this past summer (2019) in fact, I agreed to drive all the way up to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY to retrieve the children, just so we didn’t have to bicker anymore about a “halfway point” for exchanges as laid out in the parenting plan. I didn’t have to do that, but I did because it was literally 3 weekends out of the entire summer, because of vacations. I just wanted the fighting to be overwith. The only time I have “removed the children minutes before the final bell rings” was because OTHER PERSON would not confirm to me that THEY had someone picking the children up, even after repeated attempts on my part to confirm. In the end, after THEY ignored me, THEY claimed THEY had already told me that someone was picking up the kids, but when I re-read the emails, there was no such arrangement stated, which is the entire reason I was trying to confirm with THEM. OTHER PERSON claims I have “instructed” the kids to ignore THEIR pick-up instructions. I have no idea what THEY'RE talking about; that is false. THEY provides no citation or example of this. OTHER PERSON claims that my “goal was to force” THEM “personally to pick up the kids or have CPS get involved for abandoning the children.” Once again, this is blatantly not true. I have said that CPS will be contacted by the school if THEY does not pick up the children, or have someone pick them up for THEM, if THEY does not pick them up on time. That is their rule, not mine. I am not obligated to get to the school or pick them up from the bus stop if THEY cannot make it on time. After doing that, though, several times, or THEM abandoning the kids at the bus stop and literally telling them to break into my house ( THEY  were 8 years old at the time) if THEY wasn’t there on time. When I wasn’t home, and THEY did not have permission to tell the kids to enter my home by themselves and wait for THEM. 

OTHER PERSON does get one thing correct in THEIR declaration, and that is that the level of contention between THEY and I, and between THEIR SPOUSE and I, could not be worse. This is why I believe that the kids being picked up from school or their bus stop is the best situation for the children. OTHER PERSON uses the fact that THEIR home is now over 20 miles away (barely) in order to try and get the residential schedule changed, because THEY knows that I cannot get the children to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY by 3:50, when school lets out, which the residential schedule says is the pickup time. Thus, THEY is counting on getting the residential schedule THEY has been trying to bully me into, via this transportation clause in the parenting plan, because the drive to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY is not instantaneous, and thus the “when school lets out” time cannot be honored. THEY uses THEIR home location as the reason to invoke the arbitration, but when the kids need to be picked up or dropped off, THEY THEMself is in CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY, NOT CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY. Please do not let THEM get away with this abuse of this clause in the parenting plan.

I&amp;#39;ve tried to remove any identifying markers, this includes, gender, location and any other identifying words and I have noted where they&amp;#39;ve been changed.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to OTHER PERSONS declaration dated DATE, I, AUTHOR, submit the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OTHER PERSON is asking for a modification of the transportation arrangements based on THEM moving to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY, sometime in the past several months. OTHER PERSON lived in CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY immediately after going through mediation back in March of 2017. When THEY went through mediation, THEY was well aware that THEY was going to be permanently living in CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY, and signed the CR2A agreement willingingly. THEIR claim that when THEY signed the CR2A THEIR drive was “20 minutes” from CLOSER CITY, while true, is irrelevant, because THEY already had plans to move to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY with THEIR now-SPOUSE, then-LOVER, and the proof is there, in that within just a month or 2 of mediation, THEY did move to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY. It had to already be in the works, or at least being considered, when THEY signed the CR2A. Ever since that day, THEY has been relentlessly trying to hound me, while shirking THEIR responsibilities, and bully me into changing the residential schedule to be something convenient for THEM, with no regard for the amount of time THEY is or is not spending with our children. After all of the complaining and bullying, which included parading THEIR LOVER/SPOUSE and newborn illegitimate CHILD in front of me every chance THEY got, THEY finally moved to A CITY 15 MILES AWAY in the summer of 2018. I thought our fighting was &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; over. THEY lied under oath in front of a Commissioner in a related matter in which THEY was yet again trying to change the parenting plan, again fighting for less time with our children. THEY told the Commissioner (this is all recorded with the court on video/audio) that THEY didn’t “know anything” about any house in A CITY 15 MILES AWAY, and that THEIR case relied on the fact that THEY lived in CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY. While THEY was saying that exact thing, THEY was simulaneously preparing to move into the house in A CITY 15 MILES AWAY. THEY lived in A CITY 15 MILES AWAY for almost all of the 2018-2019 school year, and things were going fine with the residential schedule, transportation, etc. I thought, “thank goodness, now maybe we can both move on and stop fighting over the residential schedule!” Sometime in the spring or summer of 2019, for some unknown reason, THEY bought, and moved into, a brand new house in CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY again! THEY had already lived the life that THEY said was “unliveable” with our current residential schedule, and with THEIR current work schedule, and yet with no regard for THEIR relationship with our children at all, THEY moved right back into that same situation again, even though THEY works in CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY now, and worked in CLOSER CITY before that. THEY lives in CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY, again. And now, THEY’RE trying to use the transportation arrangements to bully me into changing the residential schedule to be exactly what THEY wants - less time with our children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, OTHER PERSON uses THEIR work schedule as one of the many “reasons” (excuses) that THEY cannot abide by the residential schedule and transportation. This is bogus because THEY changed jobs in December 2018, to a job with MAJOR COMPANY, in CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY. Before that, THEY had a perfectly fine job with SMALL COMPANY in CLOSER CITY, making plenty of money. Even though MAJOR COMPANY has offices on the eastside, THEY for some strange reason works in CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY. THEY knew full well when THEY took a job in CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY what that would mean as far as the residential schedule goes, and yet THEY changed jobs anyway. So, when the kids get out of school at 3:50, and off the bus at 4:05, THEY is right across the HWY bridge in CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY, not in CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY. For some ridiculous reason, THEY opts to have a babysitter pick the children up at 4pm and drive them all the way up to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY in the worst traffic of the day, and then complains about the “2+ hour commute” but then neglects to say why THEY won’t use the carpool/express lanes. I have suggested many ways for THEM to keep THEIR schedule with the kids, avoid childcare costs, and cease all of our fighting, but THEY will not budge. As it stands right now, THEY is trying to get away with charging me for over 4 hours each day for childcare, because the babysitter commutes in the heaviest traffic of the day to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY, and then keeps watching the kids until OTHER PERSON also finishes THEIR commute, at 8pm! I don’t understand why THEY can’t do the commute with the kids instead of hiring someone to do it. At least then the kids would have extra time to spend chatting and bonding with their PARENT. But no - THEY can’t be bothered to do that. THEY refuses to consider even one of my ideas, and yet gives no explanation as to why the ideas are not acceptable to THEM. Keep in mind, we are talking about 2 weekends per month, which means 2 Thursday afternoons, 2 Friday mornings, 2 Friday afternoons, and 2 Monday mornings. Some of my ideas have been (this is not an exhaustive list, by any means): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a sitter pick the kids up from school, which is very close - walking distance - to both a park with a playground and a public library that is open until 8pm, then THEY can drive to the park/library after work and pick them up from there. The sitter would need to be with the children for maybe 2 hours or so, which is completely normal for after school childcare. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a sitter pick the kids up from school and drive the children to CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY to meet THEM somewhere closer to THEIR work. Again, this would be very convenient for THEM, and would mean that a sitter only watches the kids for a couple of hours a few times per month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;THEY can get off work early 4 days per month to pick the kids up THEMself, avoiding childcare costs, and make up the hours on other days/evenings or weekends. If THEY needs to make them up at all, which is doubtful. All of the large INDUSTRY firms are extremely flexible with hours, especially if the reason is taking care of their children. I don’t see any reason THEY can’t be bothered to get to work a little bit late for THEIR children. Again, THEY has to commute to CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY for work anyway, so it would be fairly simple for THEM to travel down I-405 instead of I-5 to drop THEIR kids off at school. Instead, THEY wants to make me drive to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY, for some unknown reason. Except I know the reason - THEY is trying to bully me into changing the residential schedule to be what THEY wants - just 48 hours twice per month - using the transportation clause as the reason/excuse. THEY has repeatedly asked for the residential schedule to be changed to Friday at 8pm to Sunday at 8pm, and THEY&amp;#39;RE upset that I won’t just let THEM ignore our children until it’s convenient for THEM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the morning commute to take the kids to school, THEY can drop the kids off on THEIR way to work, like most parents have to do. While this means that 4 days per month THEY will get to work about an hour later than normal (if, in fact, THEY is not also lying about the time THEY normally gets to work), I think in order to spend more time with THEIR children, that is a sacrifice THEY should be willing to make.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OTHER PERSON is asking for the residential schedule to be modified to suit THEIR ideal situation for having moved to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY, again. As you are well aware, the residential schedule is not something that is required to be arbitrated, and thus any changes in schedule THEY is asking for should be ignored. If THEY wants the schedule changed, THEY has other means to go about that, and I am happy to explain to a Commissioner how hard THEY has pushed to spend less and less time with THEIR children, shoving them off on babysitters to commute with, instead of taking that commute time as an opportunity to bond with the children, all because the residential schedule is not THEIR ideal schedule is THEIR ideal world. What matters to me is what’s ideal for the children, not what is ideal to THEM. The children already ask me every so often why  THEY  can’t see their PARENT more, and if anything messes with the schedule at all,  THEY  cry and try to hide it from me, silently suffering on their own. I try to comfort them, but as  THEY  are getting older,  THEY  would rather I not know that  THEY  are crying. I have covered up OTHER PERSON’s desire to spend less time with them, and I try very hard not to involve them in OTHER PERSON’s violations of the parenting plan unless I absolutely have to.&lt;/p&gt;

OTHER PERSON claims I have “instructed” the kids to ignore THEIR pick-up instructions. I have no idea what THEY&amp;#39;RE talking about; that is false. THEY provides no citation or example of this. OTHER PERSON claims that my “goal was to force” THEM “personally to pick up the kids or have CPS get involved for abandoning the children.” Once again, this is blatantly not true. I have said that CPS will be contacted by the school if THEY does not pick up the children, or have someone pick them up for THEM, if THEY does not pick them up on time. That is their rule, not mine. I am not obligated to get to the school or pick them up from the bus stop if THEY cannot make it on time. After doing that, though, several times, or THEM abandoning the kids at the bus stop and literally telling them to break into my house ( THEY  were 8 years old at the time) if THEY wasn’t there on time. When I wasn’t home, and THEY did not have permission to tell the kids to enter my home by themselves and wait for THEM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OTHER PERSON does get one thing correct in THEIR declaration, and that is that the level of contention between THEY and I, and between THEIR SPOUSE and I, could not be worse. This is why I believe that the kids being picked up from school or their bus stop is the best situation for the children. OTHER PERSON uses the fact that THEIR home is now over 20 miles away (barely) in order to try and get the residential schedule changed, because THEY knows that I cannot get the children to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY by 3:50, when school lets out, which the residential schedule says is the pickup time. Thus, THEY is counting on getting the residential schedule THEY has been trying to bully me into, via this transportation clause in the parenting plan, because the drive to CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY is not instantaneous, and thus the “when school lets out” time cannot be honored. THEY uses THEIR home location as the reason to invoke the arbitration, but when the kids need to be picked up or dropped off, THEY THEMself is in CITY 15.5 MILES AWAY, NOT CITY 1.5 HOURS AWAY. Please do not let THEM get away with this abuse of this clause in the parenting plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respectfully and truthfully,&lt;/p&gt;

Some background to the current situation, I flew home to check on my elderly mother suffering from some health issues and was met with a full house as my sister is staying with us and going through a lot. My mother never had a partner and adopted us as a single mother. I myself have never been married, so dealing with a divorce is a completely foreign problem for our very small family. 

My \[30F\] younger sister \[27F\] married her husband \[28M\] at a young age, 5 years ago. Both my sister and her husband have always lived with mental health issues. My sister has Borderline PD, he has some social challenges being on the spectrum but seems to really suffer from his depression. In their early 20's, they weren't stable people and struggled to keep afloat. My mother enabled them financially instead of pushing them to tough it out, but it's hard to know where to help and where to step back. Our family cautiously supported their relationship, thinking that it was two people who have the capacity to empathize with eachother given their extra challenges. Anyways, they're adults who can and will make their own decisions. 

Over those 5 years, my sister has grown a lot, has an optimistic outlook on life, and has learned how to hold down jobs, be financially self sustaining, and maintain healthy relationships. Unfortunately,  (through my biased and subjective observations), it seems that he has not grown with her. He didn't have a job for years, even after getting work dragged them into debt, does not address his depression and isolates himself, and of course has become emotionally abusive to  my sister. He's never sought any treatment for his depression. I've explained to my sister that she can only assist him so much before she is just enabling him. If he is not going to reciprocate the effort she puts into their relationship no matter what his setbacks are, he's going to ruin her life. 

The straw that broke the camel's back was last week when he got a bonus at work, but then went straight to the electronics store and blew it all on video games. This is a problem because he's racked up an insane amount of debt and spent years mooching off my sister's meager wages. That was a sobering moment for her, realizing that they're never going to catch up in life with his compulsive spending habits. Luckily, things seem civil between the two of them at the moment and I saw he even posted something on facebook along the lines of ""She left, but I understand why. Please nobody say anything mean to \[sister\]. We are trying to remain peaceful"" and I hope everyone maintains that level of clarity. 

I'm sorry to say that I think this separation is a good thing. I hope she listens to her gut and continues down this path of divorce, but ultimately it is up to her to commit and follow through and I'm trying to help where I can without attempting to control the situation.

,Divorce," So divorce came through in June.  Legally separated  in April last year, but due to finances wife did not move out of house  until March this year.  The marriage has been dead for some time and my  daughter has just started college.  The divorce was not bitter no 3rd parties involved; the marriage had just run it's course (21years).  Clealy neither her mum or I did not want it to impact my daughter but like most marriages it impacted my daugher.  Her mum and I still talk.  I did try a suggestion by my daughter (meetup) and that was basically an older folk meet so this wasn't exactly stimulating for me.

I have started seeing someone recently, but when I told daughter that I was seeing a. n. other she went ballistic.  Turns out a. n. other's son was at school with my daughter and she did not like him one bit.  I did not know either a. n. other or her son until I met them. 

Daughter is refusing to come back to my house, our/her home and will instead  go to her mum's when she comes back from college.  My daughter does not want to know about a.n.other,  and although she calls me regularly about other things she will go off on one when she talks about what I have done.  This is ripping me to  shreds along with my daughter.  Daughter is everything but I need someone close to move on, share experiences and laughs.  I can't just work, come home, watch TV, eat, sleep, rinse repeat.  

I have offered to end my  relationship (which is bringing me/us a lot of happiness which I have not  had for a long time), but this to me seems to me that this is allowing  my daughter to dictate my future relationships.  Appreciate she will have her own thoughts about other people, but how do I make a checklist up of prospective partners if I went down this path? 

I do not want to lose my daughter.  She knows what can happen as her own mum has a non existant relationship with her mother due to the divorce of her parents when she was small.  As everyone who she has spoken to (inc. friends of my ex) they have all said it is too soon, so this does not help.  I know I am ready but clearly in her mind it is too soon.

Legally separated  in April last year, but due to finances wife did not move out of house  until March this year.  The marriage has been dead for some time and my  daughter has just started college.  The divorce was not bitter no 3rd parties involved; the marriage had just run it&amp;#39;s course (21years).  Clealy neither her mum or I did not want it to impact my daughter but like most marriages it impacted my daugher.  Her mum and I still talk.  I did try a suggestion by my daughter (meetup) and that was basically an older folk meet so this wasn&amp;#39;t exactly stimulating for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started seeing someone recently, but when I told daughter that I was seeing a. n. other she went ballistic.  Turns out a. n. other&amp;#39;s son was at school with my daughter and she did not like him one bit.  I did not know either a. n. other or her son until I met them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daughter is refusing to come back to my house, our/her home and will instead  go to her mum&amp;#39;s when she comes back from college.  My daughter does not want to know about a.n.other,  and although she calls me regularly about other things she will go off on one when she talks about what I have done.  This is ripping me to  shreds along with my daughter.  Daughter is everything but I need someone close to move on, share experiences and laughs.  I can&amp;#39;t just work, come home, watch TV, eat, sleep, rinse repeat.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have offered to end my  relationship (which is bringing me/us a lot of happiness which I have not  had for a long time), but this to me seems to me that this is allowing  my daughter to dictate my future relationships.  Appreciate she will have her own thoughts about other people, but how do I make a checklist up of prospective partners if I went down this path? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not want to lose my daughter.  She knows what can happen as her own mum has a non existant relationship with her mother due to the divorce of her parents when she was small.  As everyone who she has spoken to (inc. friends of my ex) they have all said it is too soon, so this does not help.  I know I am ready but clearly in her mind it is too soon.   I keep telling her we need to keep talking and the solution will come, but  I can&amp;#39;t seem to see one right now.  How to we find a solution to help us move on?&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"I am curious for those out there that are thinking about separation/divorce, in process, or already been through it, what do you think about with regards to how it will go, and what it will be like after?

I am usually perfectly fine being alone most of the time, and while my SO and I are not in a good place, and we have thrown around the D word (hopefully that is the right letter within the context of this post!) usually out of anger when fighting, and it absolutely seems like the right thing for us to do... I cant help but constantly wonder if it is. For one thing, we are older.. but still a good 1.5 decades away from retirement, but I lack any sort of retirement savings, where as my SO has a decent setup with a retirement plan at work and some IRA setup. So there is that bit that worries me a little.. like my job is not secure and I am not entirely sure what happens if we got divorced and I lost my job.. I would probably be doing some $15 an hour job to make ends meet, and that wont even come close to cover costs where we live. It is a long story about job stuff, so suffice it to say, I am trying to find ways to bring in more income in case I lose my job.

The other thought I get is what some others have said.. the idea of me not having someone to rely on in case of being sick or needing a ride, or just want to vent about work or the kids.. sure you can turn to friends, or lately reddit, but still, it is a weird thing to think about. Like we have been together a long time, and it just sucks that we are in this place in life and possibly considering this drastic change.

So often, after things calm down a bit.. I wonder.. is it worth it? Would it be better to just deal with the same crap we been fighting over for years and years, but have someone to grow old with.

,Divorce,"The first kid's birthday party post separation and divorce is coming up. After hearing the idea in a divorce care group and talking to some other divorced folks about it, I decided to do separate birthday parties (I host one, and if she wants to host one, fine). I informed my ex-wife that this is how it would be. Well, I scheduled a party with my family and three of my kids' friends families. This is for a 6-year-old, so most of their friends come through me and my ex-wife's friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a call from my ex-wife today saying that she was upset that I would invite them without talking to her first, saying she felt stuck unable to invite them and have a party. The three families I invited are mutual friends of both of us, however I believe my ex has only really kept in touch with one of them; the other two are my best friend's family (whose wife she's hung out with once, maybe twice since separation) and a family who I know she has not spent any time with since before we separated (I see them all at least monthly). I understand being upset about the one family, but the others don't make much sense to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her I was sorry she felt that way, but that it's already planned and there's no way to change it. (I know ""I'm sorry you feel that way,"" is kind of sucky language, but I didn't know what else to say.) I told her that I left a whole week between telling her I would host my own before I invited anybody, so she could've reached out to me and said, ""Hey can you not invite this kid, so I can?""

&amp;#x200B;

She asked why we wouldn't just do it together, saying we'd have other things to do together (parent-teacher conferences was the example she gave). I said, ""I have no desire to do anything with you that I don't have to. And I have no desire for our families, who all know what happened (marriage ended because she cheated multiple times), to have to awkwardly spend time with each other."" She hung up on me and then texted me to let me know she was blocking me from all social media. It seemed out of the blue, and I still don't get why that was her response; I un-followed her long ago. That part doesn't bother me though. But it does make me question whether I'm in the wrong here.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this is a better post for AITA, but I know folks here will probably have better insight being in similar situations. I'm not seeking validation; I want to know if I mishandled this or if I'm being unreasonable. I want to be a good co-parent. At the same time though, I really think the best thing for the kids would be if we continued to do stuff like this separately, because I'll be much less stressed, and we won't have to awkwardly interact. I'm planning to sit separately at kids' choir concerts, sports events, etc. I'll never be friends with her, but I'll also never disparage her to the kids, and I'll always try my best to be amicable. Am I wrong about that approach?

&amp;#x200B;

I have not responded to her yet, but I'm thinking of saying something along the lines of ""If you want to trade off every year who has a birthday party with friends, we can do that."" Although, I kind of want to point out that two of these families are my friends who I keep in touch with, and she hasn't.

Originally the other parent had majority custody because they had the better job/location, whereas I would have to move home. Things have changed now. I found a better job, I&amp;#39;m able to get a place with a room for my kid (he&amp;#39;s 4). Because the divorce is not finalized, is there something I can do to change the divorce agreements? It looks like it would be way more difficult to make changes to custody after. We have filed.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"So basically about 2 months ago my dad left for vacation to goto his home country in Iran. 2 weeks into his 1 month vacation he calls my mom says he wants a divorce, my mom and my aunt and my sister spam my phone while I’m at the gym to get home so I get home. There flipping out in the living room screaming at someone over the phone my mom and my sister, my aunt is like okay let’s go out I need to get something from the grocery store and I’ll explain to you what your dad has done. I’m just like k, so I drive her and she starts saying yea ur dad said that he doesn’t love u anymore or your sister and that he want to divorce your mom and said that the kids are old enough now to be in their own. And I’m just like what that sounds nothing like my dad cause I’m pretty close with him. So I end up saying okay let me just hear my dads side of this story, and my aunts like your not mad or upset or anything he wants to bring another woman into this house and kick u guys out. I’m like yea that doesn’t sound like my dad I’m just gonna hear his side of the story. So I get back their on the phone with my dad my mom and sister yelling at him. So I grab the phone and ask him what’s going on, he says he doesn’t want to involve me and to leave it alone a few times actually. But I persist I say what’s with this other woman their talking about what’s going on explain. So he naturally explains everything, he wants a divorce from my mom because he feels he just is not compatible with her. For years he hasn’t been, he hasn’t been happy and he just doesn’t feel like she’s good for him. He has felt this way for over a decade but because me and my sister were small he didn’t want to ruin anything for us. So my moms like screaming at me “I got a call from someone saying; ma’am u need to control your husband he wants to marry my daughter..” so my mom now thinks he went to Iran to sleep with her (btw I have no clue who this woman is I’ve tried to ignore any info ab her.) so my mom and sister somehow have her number and start to call her multiple times a day first it’s my mom swearing at her and screaming at the top of her lungs, then she hands the phone to my sister to yell at her and swear at the top of her lungs. And then idk but I think that woman said something back which was offensive to my mom and my sister retaliated and threatened to kill her and much more horrible shit. Then the woman offends my sister. Now my dad gets back from seeing his family back home in Iran, I pick him up from the airport I don’t want to hear a thing ab any part of this so I ask him how his trip was and we catch up on everything hadn’t seen him for a month. Then he gets home that whole night after getting home 9pm from 48hrs no sleep and jet lag my mom starts a whole fuckn fight with my sister involved and encourages my sister to yell and swear at my dad. A lot of yelling, swearing, I’m gonna tip that bitches head off cut her throat blah blah blah bunch of bullshit. My dad just tells my mom I want to separate that’s it I don’t plan on selling the house or ruining any of your lives here I want to separate from you and hopefully you can be mature and we can run a business in the future together so we have something to pass down to our kids. My mom responds with, u deserve spit in your face your sick if your think I’m gonna do a business with you. Now mind you they haven’t been happy for 6 years now, barely talk at home when they see each other barely even a hi or hello don’t even sleep in the same room together. My mom says I’m not divorcing you so u can ruin our lives. My dads like I’m not ruining anyone’s life I busted my ass for you guys to live here and have this life why would I throw it away. And my moms like fuck u really loud, and my sister is on her side. A couple fights like that later tonight, same idea my dad trying to not involve my sister and me, but my mom keeps saying no they have to be involved. Mom dad leaves the room because it’s like 1 am and he has work the next day, he leaves so he can stop the fighting they follow; he leaves again they follow and continue to yell eventually they start hitting him my mom throws a water bottle at him and he tries to leave then they try pushing him down the stairs as he tries to go to the basement to get away. At that point I interfered when I heard hitting. I mean I’m sort of a bigger guy I was able to pull my sister and mom boy back away from my dad and get it to stop. But it’s is getting out of hand my mom keeps doing this like every week and it’s just getting worse last week she allegedly almost got a heart attack they were at the hospital after a fight just like this. I wasn’t home so not sure what exactly happened but got home at 4 am and no one was home. But today I couldn’t believe the way my sister hit my dad, her own dad. I said to him him I can’t believe she did that and I’m like I can’t believe she said the same thing mom said you deserve spit in your face. He literally stood there and said to me, she spit in my face too. I couldn’t believe it that’s where I draw the line I tired of this my mom and my sister are sick people it’s to the point where I’m afraid for his life right now. I stay up in the living watching the basement door making sure my sister or mom doesn’t sneak down and kill him while he sleeps, like I’m genuinely concerned for his safety. 
I need some kind of advice as to how to make a hard headed woman like my mom to involve me or my sister, to deal with her problems on her own.

We have a young child together with shared custody so we are still in contact and see each other multiple times a week. Wedding photos appeared on Facebook. My son has a step mom now. I'm experiencing lots of weird mixed emotions. Grief, relief, confusion, and shock. Guilt because I have a wonderful boyfriend. Mad because I thought I worked through things but I guess I'm not over it all yet. Feeling gross for talking to my boyfriend about it (he's been more gracious then I deserve and I hope this doesn't hurt him or worry him). Having to admit to my bf I am grieving. Annoyed it's keeping me up at night. Learning new boundaries, new routines. Glad my son has a happy dad. Detaching from someone I grew up with is scary. Trying to remember the person I married isn't who I thought he was and still is not the person I thought he was. Feeling replaced (why did he get it together for her not me? Maybe he didn't and she's in for a shock. Or she's fine with behaviors I found unacceptable). I feel bad for her because she has no clue he cheated on me repeatedly which is why she left her ex spouse. Thinking the bonds and experiences we had he now has with someone else and how I don't have that bond with someone else. I'm losing respect for myself with some of these feelings; beating myself up while down. I feel excitement to fully move on, it's terrifying and freeing. It's not like I'm still madly in love with the guy so what heck? I left him and I divorced him. We didn't divorce recently, but from the time I found out he had a girlfriend to when they got married was less than a year so he married her quickly. I'm not heartbroken, I am in love with someone else, but I am hurting from grief. My ex in laws dropped our son off to me today because my ex spouse is on his honeymoon and while conversation was friendly, I felt sad, because they have a new daughter in law. I have not seen my ex spouse yet since the marriage. 

My life will not go as planned and that is 100% certain now, crystal scarily clear. What if I don't find my happy ending like he has? There's no guarantee I will remarry.

,Divorce,"30(F), married almost 5 years. Sexually frustrated and STBX, takes advantage of the situation, I also dont try to stop him like I could have. Its agony to have feelings and want intimacy with the person who wants to let go, throw everything away.

,Divorce,"Hi All,

I \[34M\] and my STBX \[34F\] decided last month over a stupid fight that we should divorce.

A little background: Our marriage was on the rocks last year, leading up to her becoming unfaithful and having emotional and physical affairs. I found out when I snooped through her phone and her telling strangers she met off Tinder about how our sex life was bad and that ""last time I *came* was not with me ex (me)"" - evidence of cheating.

There was a 12 day separation during which I took time off work on stress leave. I was an absolute wreck. How can someone do that to me? nerves shot, 3hrs sleep a night, I was close to being committed.

After talking to my step mother, who I respect a lot, she told me if there even one ounce of love left for that woman, we should try to save the marriage. I listened.

My wife was also pleading and begging me to come back.

In the following months, she hesitantly dropped the guy she was having an emotional affair with. She also refused to admit to the physical affair. But because I still loved her, I forgave her regardless.

Throughout the course of a year things seemed to get better. I changed - quit smoking pot, joined the gym so we could do fitness classes together and started to communicate a bit more and being more attentive and actively listening.

Things were looking decent, although the trust issues still existed and the safety net of our relationship was frayed, we were getting past it. I was also very hesitant moving forward in the marriage due to the pain that was felt during the affairs. I believe trust is something that's earned. So I made a mental effort to reflect back on the relationship every 4 months or so to see if I want to continue to pursue it. 

January rolled around - Things are OK

May - Things are ok, we moved to a different house, money issues and the stress associated with it were almost gone (downgrade)

September - My friend was hosting a Birthday party at a bar. I asked my STBX wife if its OK to have night out and drink with the boys since it was being hosted at our old watering hole. She said no problem. She found out later in the week that it wasn't *Boys Only* which for some reason infuriated her. Now, I like to drink because I don't do it very often, especially since we have two daughters under 6yo. And when she drinks, she has no self control after that *tipping point*, if you know what I mean.

So I told her that I just want to have a night out with the boys and that I don't want her there with our girls. She absolutely blew up! She started accusing me of being embarrassed about her - which, once she surpasses the *tipping point* she becomes irritable, loud, obnoxious and physically violent - which is fucking embarrassing.

To paint you a picture of what she can be like, she had destroyed my walk in shower in my old house, destroyed vanities, punched holes in walls, thrown lamps, hit me across the head with a plastic tool case and, while driving down the highway at 120km/h in the rain, screaming at me, punching my arms and, my favourite, smashing my windshield with her boot and other damage to my car.

Anyways, while we're arguing about the party she says something along the lines of ""well I can't be with someone who thinks of me like that - I want a divorce!""

We officially separated on Sept 7th.

Not even one week after separation (and still living in the same house) she starts talking to other guys. In front of me. In front of the kids. Flirting, Laughing, Date Planning. Holy fuck.

3 weeks after date of separation, shes in a full blown emotional relationship with a guy.

Any time I see her, she's in her phone. Texting, giggling. She moved out last Saturday and I couldn't be more relieved.

So, Reddit, How am I supposed to handle this? I doubt jumping to another guy so shortly after an 8yr relationship (5 married) is very healthy, but it gives me crippling anxiety just thinking about this.

Any advise is much appreciated.

,Divorce,"So basically around 3 months ago my wife of 14 years had an affair, and a week later signed a year lease on an apartment and left our 3 young children in my care in our marital home.  She did not have them overnight at all since about a week ago for 2 days and didn't see them much previous to that.  An hour here or there.  

Now that her affair is ended and I've been trying to get child support she states that she wants them 50/50 mostly to avoid child support.  She moved into a 1 bedroom apartment so I'm having trouble figuring where my children will live and sleep 50% of the time.  We both make around 100k a year.  

In exchange for child support she has offered to sign the house completely over to me with no equity to her, take on all her own debt including 2 cars (I have none), pay for half of the healthcare that I pay weekly, pay for half of daycare, half of all the kids expenses, and basically have the kids 50% of the time although my older son refuses to go with her at any point.  So she will basically take the 2 younger ones 50% of the time.  

Part of me feels like that's a pretty good deal - but part of me wants to fight for full custody since she left and the children and they are in their own routines and she technically doesn't have the space to keep the children at her apartment.

,Divorce,"This post is primarily directed at people who are going through or have gone through a non-amicable divorce.

My marriage ended in early April in a ball of flames - went from starting the month thinking we were at our strongest to a mental health crisis and hospitalization, to fights, to agreeing the marriage was over. 


He moved out of our shared apartment mid-May and I moved back in. The place was a disaster. He came back with his new girlfriend and tried to take my cat. It was altogether traumatic and that was the last time I saw him.

Since then I have gone through counselling and a lot of growth. I journal continuously, spend time with my family, and am trying to focus on building a better self.

He has contacted me once - to request reconciliation which I couldn’t do and told him so, nicely. I asked if we could get coffee and discuss what had happened and he said he couldn’t.

Since then I have tried casually dating and I am discovering there is a lot of insecurity in my mind regarding this failed marriage.

I am constantly wondering what I could have done different or better, and I want to hear that it was not my fault to some extent. I can share blame. But the way things were left, it was clear he felt like a lot of the reasons he was unhappy were things I contributed to. And I don’t want that.

It’s scary. I know time and perspective will help too. It was emotionally volatile and for the most part I am much happier now.

My question is - if I give it time, will my insecurities resolve? Will I gain closure by myself? Right now it feels like a chat over coffee would help, but would it actually rip new wounds in me?

,Divorce,"Thanks for reading, mostly writing this to kinda put things in perspective to myself after having some doubt this morning. 
I’ve (30m) been in a number of relationships throughout my relatively naive dating years of half my life. Of those relationships two stick out the most, my first and my latest one before my current.

I first met my first gf when I was around 16yro as a Junior in High school to her freshman. We dated through my graduation before her parents go another job in another state and had to move, though we continued as a long distance relationship. Eventually I decided to go after her and moved to be with her, which I stayed for almost two years. Try as I might to get a job as a Medical assistant after finishing classes while living there I couldn’t hold down a job with my inexperience and her father eventually wanted me out reasonably because a lack of rent money. I was forced to move back home to my folks during my grandparents near end of life days, started getting jobs more often for longer periods saving up money to hopefully move back some day. That was when she decided she didn’t want to be in a long distance relationship with me anymore and found someone else to love. About 7 years together with 3 of them distant came to a end.

I had a few short term long distance relationships after that before meeting what would eventually become my ex-wife (now 28f). She had just gotten to the end of her marriage with her first husband, mother of boy I adored, we got along quite well. Again eventually I ended up moving to be with her, this time further away than my last move. We lived together with her folks for the nearly four years together, we got married over a year ago. Then in January this year she decided she didn’t want to continue being married to me after 6 months. Claimed that she learned from her previous marriage of 5 years with a lying cheating husband that despite my never cheating, always paying for anything and everything she wanted or needed, doing what I could while not at work that she was unhappy and didn’t want to live that way. She refused to try working with me to fix our marriage, and by April 2nd we were divorced, with me moved back to my folks about a month later.

During the divorce a friend of mine helped me through the pain as best as she (40f) could. Eventually we started developing feelings for each other despite my explaining that I feel like broken goods, everything I thought I knew of being a good husband let alone boyfriend dashed to the rocks with my still fresh divorce. Meanwhile she was afraid she wouldn’t be good enough having gone almost 10 yrs without a boyfriend. She was willing to give me time to heal while living with my folks, while I wanted to give her time to figure out if she wanted to continue a relationship with me prior to any possible moving to be together. It’s been over half a year now and while I’ve thought about it in the past it’s only increased in recent weeks about the logistics of me moving a third time after a woman I hope to be my forever love and wife one day. All the while she’s practically going through anxiety attacks thinking of ways to make me comfortable enough with the prospect of moving without imposing a deadline. To some extent I feel like I’ll always have that doubt in the back of my head of why if this fails like the others. Despite this I’m both excited and dreading the concept of moving again to a third state where I have no family present to fall back on should things fall through.

I guess what I’m hoping to get across with this bit of a rant is that I’m possibly too optimistic for my own good, but I’d rather that than be forever depressed about my past failures while those women go on to live happy lives with whoever they found to replace me.

,Divorce,"We were together for 9 years. Married for 6 and have 2 children ages 7&amp;4. We both were fairly toxic for our whole relationship.  Me with being unfaithful alot and her doing the same to me for ""revenge"". She left me in febuary with the mantra of ""I need to leave to better myself so that I can come back snd we can be better""  and started spending everyday with her current boyfriend whom she started dating 2 months and she claims I ""pushed her I to his arms"" with how shitty I was being. I also got into a relationship but have broke. It off since realizing I couldn't give her 100% bc of feelings for my ex wife. In August my ex came to me and told me she missed me and still loved me and still wanted to be with me. So we started talking..spending time together and even more recently kinda started a timeline as to when we would get back together.

She is currently living under him and does not want to move back in with me bc it will get toxic very fast..which I do agree with. So in her words for now she is ""playing the part"" until she has enough money saved up to get her own place. Well recently this past week we started talking...ALOT more. We even went as far as to talk about having sex and she even sent me a photo of her in the shower. Well...I started pushing a little more with us being together and then she started talking to me less and less over 2 days bc of work and just other stuff that she was ""busy"" with. But when at work every morning would send me a text stating that she loves me and does want to be with me.

Well today she told me that I was being too clingy and trying to control what shes doing. I was getting frustrated bc I felt like everything else was more important than us talking. And she told me that she knows she wants to be with me. She just doesnt know when bc she is not In the right mindset for us to be together. And she told me that she would be upset and/or mad if I started dating someone else bc she does want to be with me. But I did ask if being with him makes her happy and she said yes. But being with me makes her happier.

So essentially..she wants me to wait on her, while she Is with some other guy and my kids almost everynight. Telling him she loves him. Sleeping beside him. Spending time with him. Meanwhile..I'm just here...alone..waiting. and its killing me inside.

Her long text today in the middle said ""we have been through so much in the last 9 years, and at some point we will have many more memories to make together, you will always be my person. I just cant make a decision like this right now""

Married for 6 and have 2 children ages 7&amp;amp;4. We both were fairly toxic for our whole relationship.  Me with being unfaithful alot and her doing the same to me for &amp;quot;revenge&amp;quot;. She left me in febuary with the mantra of &amp;quot;I need to leave to better myself so that I can come back snd we can be better&amp;quot;  and started spending everyday with her current boyfriend whom she started dating 2 months and she claims I &amp;quot;pushed her I to his arms&amp;quot; with how shitty I was being. I also got into a relationship but have broke. It off since realizing I couldn&amp;#39;t give her 100% bc of feelings for my ex wife. In August my ex came to me and told me she missed me and still loved me and still wanted to be with me. So we started talking..spending time together and even more recently kinda started a timeline as to when we would get back together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is currently living under him and does not want to move back in with me bc it will get toxic very fast..which I do agree with. So in her words for now she is &amp;quot;playing the part&amp;quot; until she has enough money saved up to get her own place. Well recently this past week we started talking...ALOT more. We even went as far as to talk about having sex and she even sent me a photo of her in the shower. Well...I started pushing a little more with us being together and then she started talking to me less and less over 2 days bc of work and just other stuff that she was &amp;quot;busy&amp;quot; with. But when at work every morning would send me a text stating that she loves me and does want to be with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well today she told me that I was being too clingy and trying to control what shes doing. I was getting frustrated bc I felt like everything else was more important than us talking. And she told me that she knows she wants to be with me. She just doesnt know when bc she is not In the right mindset for us to be together.

,Divorce,"Hello and I’m sorry for this pity post. I’m just lost and really don’t know what to do. 

I was married to the woman of my dreams for 10 years, together for 12 years. Everything I wanted and more then I deserved. I worshipped the ground she walked on.  A sexy redhead that understood me and my family too, and we were soulmates. 

One time, I got drunk. We were at home and I drank too much. An accident happened and she got hurt; her hand burnt on the stovetop. I had knocked her over and burned her hand — she said I did it on purpose; in my mind I was looking at her butt wanting to touch it as a husband does and accidentally pushed her and she fell into the burner.  It really doesn’t matter.  I made a mistake and lost her — I have to live with it being my fault. 

After that, she left me.  Now I’m a 30s aged guy divorced and forced to live in the upstairs of my parent’s house. 

We were perfect for so long, and she’s just gone. Every second of every day I think about her.  She sees me as an abusive guy that she can’t trust — I see me as a guy that made a mistake drinking too much and living the outcome.  She never wants to talk to or see me again, she will rapidly move on. She’s very pretty and stuff and it will be easy for her. 

Every second, of every minute, of every hour, day, and week I think of her. How she isn’t there and she’s off doing whatever with someone else. Things we used to do with someone else.  I’m starting to get where I don’t know how I’ll get through the 40-50+ years of my life without her. 

I really worshipped her as my soulmate. Everything I do is a reminder she isn’t there or is a reminder of what I lost.  

I’ve started drinking too much and not caring about my life or self preservation. I just want a woman back I cannot get and it kills me to the core. I cry every day after a long while still and I feel myself getting worse. I miss everything about my life. 

I’m a heavy nerd that likes being a homebody and antisocial and she loved that too. I’m also a redhead guy, she was a hot redhead. 

So how does a fat, antisocial, homebody, nerd guy move on after he has lost the best thing he will ever have?

All I think about is her. All I want to do is things she likes which makes me think about her. I have no friends and no social life — she was my best friend and social life. I wake up and cry and go to bed and cry. 

I can talk more but no one cares.  

How do you move on from the best thing you’ve ever had in your life when you feel responsible and sorry; but they don’t care and move on? I do not know how I’m going to live 40-50+ more years without her. 

Just want to be ok but feel like I never can meet anyone else and never can have her back. I don’t want to be alone.

,Divorce,"He's leaving soon, and I am a total wreck!!! My partner and I have been together for 10 years (I'm a 30 year old woman, he's a 32 year old man). We never married, but have been common law for many years, no children. We have been very up and down for many years, mostly because of career stress. I was raised in a very high stress, anxious home with a lot of fighting. He was raised in a very abusive home as well. I argue quite a bit to get my way, he cannot handle any arguing, raised voices, anything. Despite this, I am very easy going for the most part. When he gets upset, he gets upset for DAYS. No matter what the case is. I apologize up and down to no avail. Basically, it has been made clear for years that if we so much as have a tiny issue/fight/argument he's out. For the last year or so, even the tiniest thing sets him off. He's been threatening to leave me for years; but then will also say the only way to get me to listen is to threaten me. So I stopped believing the threats. As crazy as all this sounds, the fights are not that often. For the most part, we get along great. We spend loads of time together doing activities, travelling, etc. But as soon as I so much as show a small amount of anxiety over something - BAM - the issues restart as if our whole lives are falling apart. It's always been insane to me, because I don't even recognize the person he describes me to be. And I view our relationship and our issues completely differently. I always saw our relationship as mostly positive with some small issues. He sees our relationship as an absolute train wreck, and he resents me. And it shows. I try SO hard. I have begged him to go to councilling with me, and he refuses and claims that if I haven't tried anything myself he's not going to work either. Yet he still expects me to change. He says he offered to help me change years ago, and I wasn't interested so now I'm on my own and he's checked out. Yet, he stayed. Probably because I begged. And I am still begging. As usual, we got back to normal, which I describe as good after our last fight. But I decided to write a heart felt letter asking for us to work together to improve, and saying that I need love and care and support, and I don't feel any of that from him because he is SO angry at me, always. And I have gotten scared of upsetting him because once he's upset I can't get him to calm down. 

So he read the letter, and really improved for a few weeks. But we never discussed it. So on Sunday, he asked to discuss it. I read it out loud. And in the end he said, ""Can I ask you a controversial question? Can I move out for 3-6 months to clear my head and decide what to do?"". He says we'd stay together in this time, as in not cheat, but he is so stressed because of me and because I am so hard to live with and deal with that he can't decide what is best for him to do. Initially I agreed. Then he told me he can only get a one year lease, and will be taking everything he needs from the home we share to do this move, that was initially supposed to be temporary. Since then I have just lost it totally. I am no longer clear headed. I can't sleep, eat, stop crying, or work. I'm writing this at my desk while crying. Everyone in my life disagrees with the way he views me, everyone says he is too sensitive and is asking for the world when he says no one should fight or argue at home or that no one should take anything out on their spouse. He calls me abusive, but I just don't see it and no one else does either. Yet, because I love him SO much, and I want to be with him SO badly, I just ignore the bad and move forward. I've been begging him for the last two days to change his mind and not to go. But to no avail. He says all he wants is to be alone and to not be stressed and it'll take him at least 3 months to let go of the stress he feels all the time just by being around me. Despite the fact that I have improved substantially, and he knows it, he just doesn't forgive me and can't let his guard down around me. Despite being more broken than I have ever been, I just cling to the hope that he'll calm down, realize he loves me, and work with me to improve things from our home. But I know that won't happen. 

So that's why I'm here. I am desperate to know how to move through this pain, and to stop begging him to stay when he clearly is just disgusted and bothered by me (he doesn't even show a shred of emotion when I cry).

- Fails to follow through on promises to do things? No discussion can make a person reliable, get out. 

- Speed Dating session got me a bunch of numbers but no one came to flirt with me at the afterparty? Those numbers go in the trash.

,Divorce,"As I’ve mentioned in previous posts, I (39/F) am stuck in a cohabitation situation with my spouse (41/F) and our two kids (both under 10). The theme of our relationship is major control issues on her end and major passivity issues on my end. We are in an apartment that is basically two apartments stuck together - a three bedroom/two bathroom on one side and a two bedroom/two bathroom on the other side, split by common areas. We moved here shortly before the relationship collapsed. 

I was sleeping in the tiny master bedroom on the 3BR side, across from my kids’ bedrooms. My spouse started sleeping on the couch in between my bedroom and the kids’ bedrooms, but she claimed the large master bedroom on the far 2BR side as her own. She also set up a desk and workspace in the common area right outside my bedroom door, and she sits there every night from the time the kids go to bed until she goes to sleep on the couch that is also right outside my bedroom door. It felt as if a prison guard was monitoring my room,  and my blood pressure went through the roof if I needed to emerge for any reason.  

Early on when we were still in marriage counseling I asked her to switch bedrooms with me so I could be in the far half of the apartment and we’d have almost no reason to cross paths when the kids weren’t around or after they went to bed. Her response was that she didn’t want to do it but if I was forcing her to, then she would. I figured that meant I would pay in all sorts of other ways and dropped it. (This is a classic example of the control/passivity dynamic between us.) I retreated to my prison cell where I’ve been for the last month or so, stressed out and unhappy and anxious. 

Yesterday after a particularly fraught encounter I told her that it was time for us to switch bedrooms. She was still pissed off about it (the far bedroom is much nicer) but I made it clear that I was not going to back down. I spent this evening organizing my new, prison guard-free space. The nighttime anxiety is almost completely gone. There is a huge weight off my shoulders, and I am able to relax in my bedroom once again.

,Divorce,"For the entirety of our relationship (4 years dating, 3 years married, no kids), until the last 3 months, I would have said we were a very happy couple. Genuinely. Love came effortless for me… I delighted in surprising her with little gifts, writing love notes, making her tea or coffee every morning, taking her out to nice date spots many times a month. We had sex often, and it was really, really good sex. Creative, flirty, playful. We’re both artists, and we’d even schedule figure drawing nights where we draw each other nude, which always led to a fun night. She’d send me naked photos throughout the day once in a while as a sweet surprise. We travelled all over the world together.

We’ve always had such confidence about our relationship that we were comfortable with each other keeping in touch with ex’s as friends. She actually helped me reconnect with my ex wife from my first marriage (she discovered she was gay in the marriage), which I’ll always be grateful for. She'd get dinner sometimes with ex’s of hers. Never jealousy, never a breach of trust (this is important later).

That’s not to say we didn’t have our rough patches. Our relationship was great, but it wasn’t perfect, obviously. Every 6 to 9 months we’d have what we called a “funk”, where communication got stifled, she would become withdrawn, I would try hard to talk about it and ‘fix’ it. When I’d raise my concerns about whatever the issue might be (dry spell with sex, general disinterest from her, no real conversation, etc) she would always feel like I’m ""attacking her” with criticism. Over the years I became more and more sensitive to this, and tried every way imaginable to raise concerns during these funks in the softest way possible. Because I felt, in a relationship, open communication is the only way to work past issues and keep resentment from building. But every time it would turn into her becoming the victim, and me apologizing for bringing up the issue in the first place. Within a day or two, however, things would start to get back to normal and we’d be having fun again.

She, on the other hand, would rarely every raise a concern about our relationship. She’d never tell me when something I said might hurt her feelings. She’d rarely tell me she disagreed about something I wanted to do, like what we’re having for dinner or what we’re doing this weekend. I interpreted this, obliviously, as her being content.

So that’s where we’d struggle sometimes. That’s the background info.

Then last year, our dog… really, her dog that she had before we were together… was diagnosed with cancer out of the blue. Within a month, he passed away. She loved him like a child, and it was extremely traumatic for her. I was there to support her all the way through, but there was only so much I could do. It was a difficult time.

She started going to therapy, which I was glad for. She needed to open up to someone. She also started texting and talking more to an ex-boyfriend that she’s known since childhood that is a big dog lover too. This didn’t bother me. She needed to connect and find comfort, and I couldn’t be everything for her then. That’s okay.

A couple months of grief go by, and she starts to come around. And wildly, she was like a new person. We were having fun again. Her sex drive was like we were first dating again. It was incredible. I was loving it and I remember telling friends how happy we were. We even took motorcycle lessons and both bought motorcycles to go on camping trips together. I felt like we were bonded more than we’d ever been.

Now here’s when things started spiraling downward:

This summer she tells me her ex-boyfriend she was talking to all winter for support through her grief was going to be flying into town on business for 6 days. He also had just split from his long-term relationship, so she wanted to hang out to support him. Cool, I said, we should get dinner, or brunch and hang out. She said he “doesn’t really plan stuff” and danced around the idea. In my mind, I started to get a little concerned she wanted to spend a lot more time with him than a dinner or brunch. But I didn’t say anything.

The night he arrived, his flight landed at midnight. My wife was still out at her art studio. He went directly to her art studio, and spent the night there catching up until she came home at about 4am. I was at home, unable to sleep, admittedly getting really concerned. But I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, so the next day I just said that it didn’t make me feel good, and I just need some reassurance. Honestly, all I hoped for was a “Honey, I love you more than anything and you have nothing to worry about.” Issue would be over, because I trusted her.

But she couldn’t offer me that. She immediately got defensive. Angry. Said I was “attacking her” as she always does when I bring up a concern.

She saw him every day for the next 6 days. Most nights they were out until 2-3am. When he left, we had some hard arguments. I was devastated that she could disregard me and my feelings like that. I'd never seen that side of her. She argued he’s just an old friend and they have a strong connection. Soon after, we had a few constructive talks, and things seemed to be healing…

Over the next few months, I travelled out of town twice. Both times, her ex happened to fly into town for business, and they spent every day together while I’m gone. When I am home, she’s staying out until 2-3am, coming home drunk, sleeping on the couch and refusing to come to bed. She’s becoming more and more angry at me. She starts saying things like “I never get to do anything for myself,” “I got married because I felt like i was supposed to,” “I feel trapped by the house we bought,” “You’re too controlling”.

And listen, I understand my part in how she feels. I look back at the first couple years we were together and I can cringe at how strong-headed I was about what furniture I liked, what art goes on the wall, what music I thought was cool. Over the years, though, I became more aware that those off-handed opinions of mine were read as criticism to her. She often took it personally. So I’ve become much more open and encouraging of her tastes and preferences for things in the 3 years we’ve been married. And I’ve benefited from it greatly! In the last year she’s finally started playing music she loves more around me, and I love it. Her style and design taste around the house brings so much color and eclecticism into my life. It’s really been awesome and given her a lot of confidence.

But to hear her say it, you would think I was some psycho mentally abusive and manipulative guy. I. am. not. By any stretch. My family and closest friends are dumbfounded. They know that’s not at all who I am. They, and I, KNOW that I am a great husband to her—completely supportive, affectionate, and encouraging in anything she wants to do in life.

But now she is angry, confused, and completely overwhelmed. I’ve been sleeping in the guest bedroom for weeks. She avoids me at all costs. She has changed the passcode on her phone so I can’t look at her text messages (we’ve openly shared our phones with each other our entire relationship). I’ve seen she’s taken nude photos that would normally be sent to me, but I’m not receiving them. 

Though I have my resentments I’ve been kind to her, given her the space she’s been asking for, but it just keeps getting worse. She’s colder to me every day.

I’m absolutely heart-broken. I’ve no proof that she’s having an affair, but I’m not sure it matters any more. It certainly feels like an emotional betrayal. And it feels like she’s hell-bent on making me a bad guy to justify her feelings. I wish she’d just tell me if she’s falling for her ex again. I wish she’d just tell me if she’s not in love.

I know she’s in pain, and torn in every direction. I see it on her face. She’s crying all the time. And it kills me to see it, knowing my attempts to console or help will only push her away further.

We’re potentially going to try counseling next week, if I can get her to agree—though she seems resistant. I’m continuing to take care of myself (no drinking, hitting the gym, eating well) because I want to keep complete clarity during this. I hope we can get through it and be stronger on the other side, but I feel less hope every day.

Reading the posts on this community has helped me a ton, so I thought I’d share my story in case it helps someone out  there feel less alone. In the end, I know I’ll be okay. And I feel she will be too. Both of us are surrounded by friends and family that love us, and will support us in whatever outcome. I’m beginning to daydream about life being single again, having my own apartment, and part of me does feel some small excitement. Though it changes greatly by the day, by the hour.

Truly, at this point, I just want truth. And I want her to have happiness, even if that means it’s not with me. I just have to hold onto hope that it is.",t2_88up3,False,,0,False,"Blindsided, dumbfounded, looking for hope…",[],r/Divorce,False,1,,0,False,t3_dhy3nt,False,light,,public,12,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Vent/Rant/FML,False,12,,,1571091643.0,,[],[],{},,True,,1571120192.0,text,1,,text,self.Divorce,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the entirety of our relationship (4 years dating, 3 years married, no kids), until the last 3 months, I would have said we were a very happy couple. Genuinely. Love came effortless for me… I delighted in surprising her with little gifts, writing love notes, making her tea or coffee every morning, taking her out to nice date spots many times a month. We had sex often, and it was really, really good sex. Creative, flirty, playful. We’re both artists, and we’d even schedule figure drawing nights where we draw each other nude, which always led to a fun night. She’d send me naked photos throughout the day once in a while as a sweet surprise. We travelled all over the world together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve always had such confidence about our relationship that we were comfortable with each other keeping in touch with ex’s as friends. She actually helped me reconnect with my ex wife from my first marriage (she discovered she was gay in the marriage), which I’ll always be grateful for. She&amp;#39;d get dinner sometimes with ex’s of hers. Never jealousy, never a breach of trust (this is important later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say we didn’t have our rough patches. Our relationship was great, but it wasn’t perfect, obviously. Every 6 to 9 months we’d have what we called a “funk”, where communication got stifled, she would become withdrawn, I would try hard to talk about it and ‘fix’ it. When I’d raise my concerns about whatever the issue might be (dry spell with sex, general disinterest from her, no real conversation, etc) she would always feel like I’m &amp;quot;attacking her” with criticism. Over the years I became more and more sensitive to this, and tried every way imaginable to raise concerns during these funks in the softest way possible. Because I felt, in a relationship, open communication is the only way to work past issues and keep resentment from building. But every time it would turn into her becoming the victim, and me apologizing for bringing up the issue in the first place. Within a day or two, however, things would start to get back to normal and we’d be having fun again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She, on the other hand, would rarely every raise a concern about our relationship. She’d never tell me when something I said might hurt her feelings. She’d rarely tell me she disagreed about something I wanted to do, like what we’re having for dinner or what we’re doing this weekend. I interpreted this, obliviously, as her being content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s where we’d struggle sometimes. That’s the background info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then last year, our dog… really, her dog that she had before we were together… was diagnosed with cancer out of the blue. Within a month, he passed away. She loved him like a child, and it was extremely traumatic for her. I was there to support her all the way through, but there was only so much I could do. It was a difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She started going to therapy, which I was glad for. She needed to open up to someone. She also started texting and talking more to an ex-boyfriend that she’s known since childhood that is a big dog lover too. This didn’t bother me. She needed to connect and find comfort, and I couldn’t be everything for her then. That’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple months of grief go by, and she starts to come around. And wildly, she was like a new person. We were having fun again. Her sex drive was like we were first dating again. It was incredible. I was loving it and I remember telling friends how happy we were. We even took motorcycle lessons and both bought motorcycles to go on camping trips together. I felt like we were bonded more than we’d ever been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here’s when things started spiraling downward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer she tells me her ex-boyfriend she was talking to all winter for support through her grief was going to be flying into town on business for 6 days. He also had just split from his long-term relationship, so she wanted to hang out to support him. Cool, I said, we should get dinner, or brunch and hang out. She said he “doesn’t really plan stuff” and danced around the idea. In my mind, I started to get a little concerned she wanted to spend a lot more time with him than a dinner or brunch. But I didn’t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night he arrived, his flight landed at midnight. My wife was still out at her art studio. He went directly to her art studio, and spent the night there catching up until she came home at about 4am. I was at home, unable to sleep, admittedly getting really concerned. But I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, so the next day I just said that it didn’t make me feel good, and I just need some reassurance. Honestly, all I hoped for was a “Honey, I love you more than anything and you have nothing to worry about.” Issue would be over, because I trusted her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she couldn’t offer me that. She immediately got defensive. Angry. Said I was “attacking her” as she always does when I bring up a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She saw him every day for the next 6 days. Most nights they were out until 2-3am. When he left, we had some hard arguments. I was devastated that she could disregard me and my feelings like that. I&amp;#39;d never seen that side of her. She argued he’s just an old friend and they have a strong connection. Soon after, we had a few constructive talks, and things seemed to be healing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, I travelled out of town twice. Both times, her ex happened to fly into town for business, and they spent every day together while I’m gone. When I am home, she’s staying out until 2-3am, coming home drunk, sleeping on the couch and refusing to come to bed. She’s becoming more and more angry at me. She starts saying things like “I never get to do anything for myself,” “I got married because I felt like i was supposed to,” “I feel trapped by the house we bought,” “You’re too controlling”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And listen, I understand my part in how she feels.

,Divorce,"Hello, 
I (29F) was blindsided about a month ago when my husband (28M) said he was leaving me. We have a toddler together, are healthy and employed with a great house, friends and some supportive family. He has battled depression since we had our son and has had other hardships recently. We’ve gone to counseling and made progress to the point where we were not going consistently. After his initial confession of wanting to leave he had a change of heart and has made a 180 change. Saying his devotion to me and making our marriage work is stronger than ever. Even said he is open and willing for another child. And offered to try and conceive. 

However, I found out that last week he went to see a divorce lawyer. I immediately confronted him, wanting to know if he was lying about wanting to stay together and continuing with divorce. He denied wanting to leave and said he just wanted to find out how to proceed if divorce came up in the future.
I’m terrified that he is attempting to blindside me, and gather ammo against  me while I believe we are working on our marriage as a unit. 

Is there any advantage for him to be filing without me knowing? Is there anything I need to be securing or gathering proof of to protect Myself? His parents are very wealthy and connected, and are honestly awful people. I don’t allow our son around them without me. I’m so scared that he’s going to try and take our son away from me.

,Divorce,"I had a particularly hard time today.

I traveled yesterday to come out to work and had a really difficult conversation with my spouse this morning.I told her how I was caught up in looking at Facebook and Instagram and seeing how many times her new relationship would’ve commented or liked her photos. I told her I looked at our phone bill and saw that she talk to them for over three hours on the day she told me she just wanted to be able to get some space and clear head. She told me how she felt like it was snooping and I was doing something wrong by doing this. Feels like she just keeps making excuses for her behavior and blaming me. It’s so hard to think about being apart and how much it hurts when I’m away. I had a quick conversation with my boss this morning to let them know that my wife and I were going to be separated and I just needed to let him know. I had hoped telling him would help me socialize it more and maybe even feel some relief, But that wasn’t the effect.  I could feel myself becoming more and more emotional and almost crying in his office. My meditation this morning didn’t go as well as I hoped I felt more stuck in that cycle of seeing how everything is falling apart around me. I know that I’m doing the best that I can and other people tell me I’m doing all the right things to care for myself. It was really hard hard to talk to my parents today to ask them about being able to watch the kids during my surgery next week and for at least a day or two after. they asked me how things were going. I had to lie and say everything’s OK it’s just hard at work. My Mom saw that I deactivated my Facebook profile and she asked if that was because of work so I just went with that and I almost started to cry again on the phone with her and my dad. It’s been good to be able to talk to my best friend about these things But I feel like it’s not enough. I’ve been thinking of calling my sister to let her know all the things up and going on and I don’t know how to rely on her. I don’t want to admit to one other person that my marriage is over, that somehow if I just don’t tell anyone it won’t end.  I know that that’s not the case probably more of a symptom of the problems that have been a part of our relationship from the beginning, that I couldn’t admit the hard things Or that I could fix it or if I just don’t say anything I can fix it nobody has to know that it’s broken. I guess that’s what’s happening now to and need to change it. I’m not bad or wrong because the marriage is ending, I gave it my best at least the best that I was able.

,Divorce,"Dear group,  


First of all thank you all very much,  
It helps a lot coming here and seeing that we all go through similar issues,,  


Our divorce was finalised last week,  
we were 5.5 years together, married for 3.5.  
She just turned 29, and I am about to turn 35.  


We were as incompatible as you can be,  
wanted completely different things in life,  
Ver different backgrounds and childhood experiences.  
Also the way we loved one another was very different.  
She was head over heels in the beginning and lateron loved me as you would expect it to be between a husband and a wife. I on the other hand always loved her more as if she is a child that needs to be taken care of, she would even agree to that she often acts like one, etc.  


Towards the end we were both very unhappy, but still cared for each other,  
Only I was unhappy for the majority of our marriage, and always blamed myself,  
that I am the rotten apple and im the one with a list of childhood trauma's that makes it challenging to function or go through life at times. Like my own personal demons that drive me banana's. So I used to smoke weed every evening to numb the emotional pain I guess. All that while building a wonderful business in the meanwhile and working 7 days a week.  


Than one fine day I stopped smoking weed, and 1 month later told my ex wife that I think that she should start looking for someone else, someone who wants the same things as her (kids being the main reason), and that someone more like her (we are from completely different cultures) could probably make her much happier. Because also the though of holding her back from enjoying life the way she wanted was also causing me anxiety and guilt feelings.  


That was after a very, very long time of hating my life with her (still always blaming myself for this),  
Because how can someone so messed up like me leave such a wonderful, loving, super sweet, loyal person like herself.  
And here is a recurring thought... I kept idolising her eventhough it was made up in my head, and now after we are finally divorced and are 5 months separated, now the idealisation and the ""what if I did this or that"" thoughts start to creep in :-/

Every freaking morning I wake up with as if the thoughts are running from the sleep into the wake!  
Useless unproductive thoughts, random to say the least, different moments in time which I start to analyse or just ruminate in, no real value in them either. And I do understand that it's normal, and all that, but how the hell does one stop em?!  


I am in therapy, both psychotherapy, and a psychiatrist (no meds, just talks).  
The first says that its because I am completely disconnected from myself and what I actually feel,  
the second says that I am the Ambivalent type of attachment, and thats just relieving childhood trauma of when I was abandoned by my parents, and that's that :-)  


The virtues thing to have done is leave my ex, for the sake of both of us!  
I am much happier, calmer, at ease, free, sleeping way better, and much more clarity in my head than while married.  
But still, those thoughts about the what if I could just be more normal, more like her, more compassionate, forcing myself to do more of the things she liked (very superficial and dead boring in my opinion, but what IF?!), maybe I could find a way to love her differently, love her more like a partner and not a child. Maybe than I would also agree to having kids with her (I do realise how silly it sounds).  


She on the other hand as a new relationship (it did take her 4 other guys to sleep with inorder to find this one),  
and she says that she is happy and realises how unhappy she was during the marriage, which I accept, eventhough denial is one of her strongest characteristics (psychotherapists words, not only mine), and she needs to protect herself, I get it. And if she is happy I am happy for her!  


Both of my therapists say that I never connected to her, that I have tried, but it never happened,  
even the sex that started of like the best party ever, quickly turned into me avoiding it and wanting it less and less,  
we both blamed it on the stress of building a business and working ""so much"", eventhough it never felt as working too much. Also I used every free time to go for long walks with the dog, or train 6-8x a week (MMA) just to be somewhere else.  


Our communication sucked big time, we only realised it during therapy,   
but it really seemed to be a little too late at that point.   
I blame myself for most of it, although both therapist say that it's wrong and not true,  
that it takes two to tango and that the dynamics between a couple is something that you cant analyse in % of fault perse.  
So now I blame myself less, but still have guilt feelings. Eventhough all I did was actually (in my head) for the both of us.  
Just to name a few- moved to her country so that it'll be easier for her, insisted she will do a Masters and also payed for it, made her much stronger and practical than she was before we started, etc.  


O yeah, she cheated on me before we got married (met up with her previous crush and kissed on both occasions,   
so called because of my cold feet before the wedding, which I told her about, she wanted to be sure and tried that.  
She told me that after the separation already, and when I asked her why she never told me that before the wedding she replied with ""because I knew you will dump me right away, but I really wanted to be your wife and have your children...""  


So thats where I am now, jesus what a long rent :-)  


Maybe someone has some words of wisdom, can relate, or just say something that might help.  
How to stop overthinking about the what if I was only more normal and caring, maybe I would have found a way to make this marriage work...  


p.s. people say I should date,   
and there are girls that are showing real interest,   
but it's really the last thing on my mind right now,   
zero interest nor need..

&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned that I would get my attorney she said I would be paying 3-5 times as much as she does and it would only add up from there. What do I do to take care of my kids? If she&amp;#39;s this toxic already how can I keep fighting without risking losing them? I just want this to be over so I can move forward and love my kids in my own home, away from her, and be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"I read the posting guidelines so here’s my intro:

•**I’m a 37 yr old female and been “married” to my husband for a little over 11 months.** I’ve never been married prior to my current and have no children from any past relationships. My husband is a few years younger than I am. We have no children and do not own a house.

•I’m fairly certain I need legal assistance but **have no representation** at this point.

•umm — basic **reason for divorce** would be a trilogy turned into one of those movies no one goes to because the story is so farfetched. I’ll get to that after the intro.

•**Emotionally?** I’m a complete and utter disastrous wreck that’s about to shatter into pieces that will scatter across the entire globe. My emotional and mental state is not solely due to things going on in my marriage/soon-to-be divorce. I’ve reached out to people to whom I consider close friends in the past couple of weeks and those “friends” have all decided I am no longer worth speaking to for various reasons. These are all people I’ve know for well over a decade. IE - I don’t keep in contact as often as they’d like, one was upset with me due to rejecting him a year and a half ago when I was oblivious to the overture, three friends (who all know each other) have assumed I am “faking things” for attention. After this debacle, I had a constructive conversation with one of the aforementioned friends. We went over some major points about my character, as a whole. He agreed that I am not a very emotional person, I do not talk about my personal issues and that I’ve never been known to do anything that comes close to this in the past. To summarize, I lost 16 people that I thought I could count on to be there for me in the span of about a week. I’m not comfortable sharing more than that and the things I’ve said are already outside of my usual boundaries when it comes to my personal life. I’m at a point where I have quite literally no one left, not even family, so I decide it was time to look elsewhere before I am irrevocably damaged. 

•**What I would like from this?** Perhaps advice, find others that have been in similar situations, objective opinions, criticism or anything, to be candid.


**My story**
I met my husband online in 2017 and we became close. It was not through a dating site or anything where you’d expect to meet a potential partner. 
I live in the United States and he lives in the Middle East. I travelled there so we could meet, in person, sometime last year. He ended up coming to the US a couple months later and in late 2018, we married. 
Less than a week after we took our wedding vows, he told me he wanted a divorce and left the US to go back to his home country. He told me that after marrying me, it wasn’t how he expected to feel. I tried to talk him out of it, stating that six days was not enough time to give a marriage a chance. When he left, he said he would be back but needed some time to be with family again. I understood and he departed a few days later. 
What I didn’t know at the time was that he was strategically realigning himself with his ex girlfriend through a mutual friend of theirs. He did this one night while we were in bed. I remember very clearly asking what he was doing as he told me he was just chatting with a friend who was having boyfriend issues. After he left, his American phone still in my possession, I ran that conversation through a translator. Not only did he plot to reunite with his ex upon his return but when the mutual friend asked him how I would take it and if there would be any fights/arguments over it, he replied, “don’t worry, I told her I’d come back so I can get out of here without any trouble.” 

Yes, I was devastated at this point but the story is far from over. We talked every day and I convinced him to give it a chance. Major life changes are stressful on anyone and I could understand his shock from moving to a new country, getting married and being in a drastically different weather climate. It was snowing by October here and he’s from the desert, after all. He agreed to giving our life together another chance if I would move to his country, so that is exactly what I did. 

Early December I left the US, rented a temporary home for us... this might be a good time to add that he had nowhere to go back to because he was previously living with the ex girlfriend that he was trying to get back together with. They had been together up until the moment I arrived. Actually, several days after the fact, I just didn’t know it because I had been lied to the entire time about his relationship status. To continue on, I rented the home via Airbnb for a month so we’d have time to find a place of our own. One week and six days after my arrival, he told me it was not going to work out and it wasn’t what he was used to. I said that two weeks was not enough time for us to get used to each other but he simply replied, “it’s not something I want to get used to” and that he, “wanted a little housewife.” So, one week before my birthday, I left the Middle East at my husband’s request.

The second I arrived home, he had changed his mind, yet again. He missed me, he was sorry, he made a mistake and wanted me to come back. Late January, I travelled back to the Middle East with the intention of living and making a life with him there. If anyone is sensing a trend here, you can probably guess that two weeks in, I was back on a plane to the US. 

Getting shipped back and forth was exhausting. There are no direct flights from where I live to where he lives and I’d usually have 2-3 connections resulting in 36-40 hours of travel. He wanted me back before I had even landed on American soil but this time I had some reticence about the idea. 

Two weeks after I left the Middle East, in early February, he cheated on me with one of the women he regularly cheated with while he was with his ex girlfriend. The ex girlfriend I was under the impression he was no longer with. The same ex girlfriend that he was **still** with while he professed his love to me during my very first visit and asked me to be with him forever. He kept her as a backup plan in case I said no. He lied to her about where he was and he lied to me about ending things with her. I eventually moved past the cheating part of this story. A few weeks later he told me his ex girlfriend, the one and only, needed his help moving and he owed it to her because of how he left her. This is not something I was comfortable with. The man left her to be with me then left me after six days of marriage to go back to her only to change his mind again. I asked him if it was appropriate in his country for a married man to do something like this for an ex (knowing full well what the answer was) and he said it wasn’t but he needed to help her anyway. I asked him why he hadn’t even discussed it with me before promising her to help. He said that he didn’t have a chance to say no on the phone. In his country, it’s not acceptable to speak with your ex, especially if that ex is now married to someone else. I’d like to think there’s an extra layer of that, given the extreme circumstance of our particular situation. More than a month of this emotional push-pull, he agreed that I was right and acquiesced to not helping her, seeing her or having further contact with her. If this had been an ex from two relationships ago and several years of separation, I would have a very different opinion on the matter. 

Fast forwarding to July of this year, I travelled back to his country but this time with the intent on staying till early October then coming back to the US with him.  He told me he thought we had a better chance at making a life together here. His birthday was in July and we had been apart since February 4th. The chance to be with him for more than a two week duration was negligible. I was flying home two weeks and 5 days after I had arrived. This time, I wanted to leave...

He was wonderful in the beginning; more than anyone ever has been. Romantic, thoughtful, protective, affectionate; all things I am not accustomed to. As I stated earlier, I am generally on the on phlegmatic side, sanguine but careful. I typically end up dating men similar to this and I’m not someone who has ever been showered with romance. I don’t like flowers, candy or any of the typical banalities. Looking back on my own post, you’ll notice I’m sticking to a timeline of events rather than how I felt when something occurred. I am usually known for my objectivity and tend to speak in facts with evidence rather than opinion and feeling. 

The moment after we married, everything changed. I know people say this all the time but I’m an optimistic skeptic, at heart. We both changed; I adapted to his lifestyle preferences. I cooked and prepared his lunches for work which is something I’m not exactly famous for doing. I became more affectionate and open to physical intimacy, something I have difficulties with early on in relationships. His nickname for me has always been “The Ice Queen.” For clarity’s sake, I left to come back to the states on August 5th. 

Now, being back in the US, we agreed that I would “set up our life” so he could join me here in late October. Keep in mind, I had left the US with the intention of not coming back twice. I had no home of my own and no job. We had our share of disagreements during this trying time and I attempted to confront the problems with him. He told me he wasn’t willing to talk about it and if I just moved past it, it wouldn’t be a problem anymore. For me, that made things even worse. I’m a very communicative person and believe in solving problems before they become septic. After dozens of attempts to try to talk to him about the problems we were having, he grew angry and, like I predicted, the problem was now in grave danger of necrotizing. His refusal to discuss things with me pushed me into a place I’ve never been before and we were no longer on speaking terms. This is when I started turning to others whom I thought were friends. 

I lost every person I considered to be a friend in under a week. Dolorous doesn’t even begin to describe the way I felt after, one by one, my friends turned their backs on me.  

I attempted reconciliation with my husband a few times after we essentially broke, but trying to express anything to him was met with hostility, resentment and aggressive defensiveness. He was taking anything and everything I said as a personal attack no matter how gently it was said and no matter which angle I tried. 

If you’ve read this far, I’m thankful for your time and patience. I am hoping to find my faith in humanity again, above all. My experiences in life, especially these past years, months and weeks have taken such a brutal toll on me that I’m starting to become nihilistic and fear losing myself, altogether.

,Divorce,"How can you tell if you are ACTUALLY not trying hard enough in the relationship, or if the other person is just gaslighting?

My wife (35F) and I (34M) have been going back and forth for a very long time now, and I know neither of us is happy.  Her, because she tells me so, and me because I just feel like we're not going anywhere.

If you read through a lot of my old posts on this throwaway you'll see that this isn't new, and that we've been on the edge of divorce for a long time now.  We tried counseling once (a few sessions) and she felt the counselor was on my side, and was picking on her.  She refused to go back.  She started working on herself, because many people including her family were very open with how she was making them feel.

In any case, the history doesn't matter as much ebcause where we are at right now is that when she gets upset, she comes to me and says ""I am unhappy"".  When I ask her why, she says I am not doing enough to show that I care about and want to spend time with the family.  Personally I don't see this, so I ask, what can I do better? She doesn't have an anwer, I should know.  This goes on and on, and when I bring up a counselor again because clearly we are not communicating on the same page, she just refuses.

What I am getting at is, I see so many posts on here about how men are just trying the bare minimum, and trying too little too late, and I'm not sure if that's me, or if she's just pushing blame on me because we are just so unhappy together.  I have this tremendous guilt and fear that I am picking greener grass on the other side, but that I'll get over there and that it really WAS my fault the entire time!

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the history doesn&amp;#39;t matter as much ebcause where we are at right now is that when she gets upset, she comes to me and says &amp;quot;I am unhappy&amp;quot;.  When I ask her why, she says I am not doing enough to show that I care about and want to spend time with the family.  Personally I don&amp;#39;t see this, so I ask, what can I do better? She doesn&amp;#39;t have an anwer, I should know.  This goes on and on, and when I bring up a counselor again because clearly we are not communicating on the same page, she just refuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am getting at is, I see so many posts on here about how men are just trying the bare minimum, and trying too little too late, and I&amp;#39;m not sure if that&amp;#39;s me, or if she&amp;#39;s just pushing blame on me because we are just so unhappy together.  I have this tremendous guilt and fear that I am picking greener grass on the other side, but that I&amp;#39;ll get over there and that it really WAS my fault the entire time!  I just can&amp;#39;t tell what to do :-(&lt;/p&gt;

The latest now is that I am still living in fear of what to do next.

My wife has now taken our child to go stay with her parents and texted me some lawyer style text message to let me know. She basically accused me of being abusive, which is not true, first time I've heard this after I've consistently accused her of the same and she stated that she would be there for a while and that I needed to figure out what I want.

I responded back, with a legal mindset of what to say.

She responded back that we are not to text anymore and to call ( she is probably paranoid I am assuming of paper trails)

I kept asking her if I could see my daughter but she does not respond consistently so I've given up.

Pretty much she is forcing my hand to serve her so I can see my daughter. ( Not necessarily for the divorce right now, although I'm sure that will follow close after)

I don't know what to do next. Is this some game to make me crawl back to her? or is she baiting me to serve her?

Her family is guiding her through this whole ordeal for sure.

I know the marriage is beyond repair but I I keep thinking what if there is a way back? If I serve her, there is no coming back. Am I being delusional, I think I am.

I am also thinking about what to do next after I serve her, what will her reaction be, anger? She is anvery angry person to begin with.

Should I take all my stuff out my house? She is spiteful and vindictive. I need a plan before I serve her.

,Divorce,"My STBX and I have decided to divorce. We started talking about how we would handle custody of our 2 kids during the separation. The plan is to rent an apartment and we will have the kids stay at the house and the parent with custody each night will stay at the house with the kids while the other will stay at the apartment. 

Some background, she travels quite a bit, usually 2-3 days at the beginning of the week most weeks. I travel occasionally (maybe 4-6 times a year) but when I go it is for most/all of the week.

How should this work?  Am I crazy for feeling like I am getting the short end of the stick with the proposed split?  

It really sucks for me because for so long she has never asked if a given week was ok for her to travel, making it difficult on busy weeks of work for me, as I would get into work late to get the kids to school and leave early to relieve the nanny or pickup carpools.  Anyone been in this situation that can help me understand if this is one of those that I just need to grin and bear it or if this is one it is reasonable to take a stand?

The problem is, I grew up in an abusive household as well. My mother used to beat me up repeatedly (also when she was drunk). So, I grew up surrounded by this. My mom has apologized, made amends, shown remorse and our relationship is better. It took years though, to get to this place. 

Anyway, I feel that because of my relationship with my mom, I’m hoping the same thing will happen with my ex husband. Because a silly part of me wanted to give my girls what I never had: a father.

Bottom line, I’m a mess right now. Constantly conflicted. Feeling defeated and unworthy of love. I don’t feel safe, and don’t think I’ll ever be able to trust again.

,Divorce,"Hi, first time poster. 

I'm 33(f) and my soon to be ex-husband is 32(m), we were together 8 years (married for 3). I suppose I'm cleansing myself. With the decree filled (that's the last step in a UK divorce procedure) and knowing that it's only a matter for weeks before I'm free, it seemed like time to write it all down. 

It's weird, I always swore I'd stay married. That I'd choose the perfect person and stay with them because both of my parents were married three times apiece. I didn't want that, I didn't want the stigma of failing, I've never been very good with failing. I wouldn't say I was nieve but maybe a little ignorant of myself, what I needed and broken from emotional trauma in the past. 

I met my ex online, the norm for me because it's simple to dismiss people, harsh I know but I'm above average in the looks department and the attention can become overwhelming. I met him after a painful break-up, determined to be just friends because I really didn't need a boyfriend at that moment, we hung out and it was easy, it was fun. 

I think the issues began well before I met him, my choice of partner had been erratic due to a severe breakup at 18. I avoided that personality type because it was also the personality type of my father who passed away. I have always been okay with the mirror of my Dad, I'm just like him and knew that I worked best with someone like me. It's less about ""Daddy issues"" and more about complimenting personality.  Anyway, I met my ex, and with a combination of people telling me 'he was the type to settle down with' and  'this was love because it was calm, dependable'. That he 'would look after me' (not that I was ever really reliant on men but I aimed to be a mother and wanted the financial stability) and I could help him be a better person. He wanted to be a better person, after years of childhood trauma, he wanted to be kind, outgoing and not angry all the time and I, the idiot with a hero complex decided sure, that was a great idea. 

So, I committed. I committed to this angry, damaged man who worshipped me like the sun because I was pretty, smart and kind. What I didn't understand was that people who don't know how to love, communicate and reciprocate compromise will drain you. Our sex life was dull, I'd always had a high sex drive but with him, it was lacking, I figured this was a good thing because the guys who were great at sex had only ever disappointed me, the pretty guys had only ever made me feel regret at giving them a chance. This was me, still reeling from the previous relationship.

Years passed, we got married, we made plans to have kids, we brought a house and had a nice car. We had THE life, we had the life that everyone aspired too. We seemed great from the outside, happy with a solid friendship and time passed unassumingly. From the inside, I was alone most of the time. He worked away five days a week and the more he was away the more I resented him at home. We spent time in separate rooms doing separate things because it was easier. We never spent any time together really and I suppose that should have been one of a million little red flags. There were things I let go for an easy life, like not demanding his time off, letting him spend it with his friends, gaming or yet more work because he needed it. Relinquishing time to let him stay at work longer than he needed to because he saw it as necessary, though he could have been spending time with me. I never bitched, never fought it because I'd replace him in my life with other people. If I wanted to go to the spa I called my mother. The theatre? A friend. Drinks? Another friend and so on until the only things we did together were things he wanted to do. We only ate where he was happy too, only did sports, watched movies, listened to music that he wanted to and I let it happen because it was easier. Essentially, we were living sperate lives. 

Breaking point came last year. My contraception had come to its natural end and so we decided it would be a good time to have kids, (I know, it's insane). January came, I relinquished my safety net and left it to nature. It took eight months of spiralling depression, anxiety and wishing for my period every month for me to realise that this just wasn't for me. I'm not sure what finally did it, maybe reading something online or something someone said but I woke up. I realised, that not only could I not stay like this any more, but that I missed sex, great passionate sex, I missed life. Somewhere along the line, I'd buried parts of myself away because they didn't fit in with the 'Lifestyle' I thought I wanted. I realised that actually I'd never wanted kids, I liked the idea, I was great with them but I absolutely didn't want one myself. I called my ex and told him and his response was 'Well what if I want them?' and my only recourse was 'Find someone else then because it won't be with me.' That was the beginning of the end. 

Having kids to me had always been the end goal, even though looking back it had never been my dream. Get married, have kids, have a house, it was the heteronormative dream and I fell for it. I was relieved, ecstatic at my decision and eager to get back on contraception which I did within twenty-four hours. From there we tried, we opened our marriage, we talked, we cried and eventually we split, knowing that we probably should never have gone past a friendship at all. 

It's been amicable for the most part. He's grown a lot while with me and I hope some of that sticks but I can't be sure it will. The truth is he's married to his job, he loves it, it defines him and I think that's because his job can't hurt him as people can. I realised that he was never emotionally available, I needed someone who will let their walls down. I was never happy being what was essentially a housewife. I'd chosen a role that I thought I needed and he chose the thing he loved most. 

In a few weeks, this chapter of my life will be closed and I can officially begin the new one with my new, child-free boyfriend. I'm gloriously happy, I see now what I could have had, what I should have heald out for and I feel sad for the person I used to be. I suppose the point of this is that sometimes you think you know what you want, you make it happen and then actually, it's nothing like you thought it would be.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 33(f) and my soon to be ex-husband is 32(m), we were together 8 years (married for 3). I suppose I&amp;#39;m cleansing myself. With the decree filled (that&amp;#39;s the last step in a UK divorce procedure) and knowing that it&amp;#39;s only a matter for weeks before I&amp;#39;m free, it seemed like time to write it all down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s weird, I always swore I&amp;#39;d stay married. That I&amp;#39;d choose the perfect person and stay with them because both of my parents were married three times apiece. I didn&amp;#39;t want that, I didn&amp;#39;t want the stigma of failing, I&amp;#39;ve never been very good with failing. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say I was nieve but maybe a little ignorant of myself, what I needed and broken from emotional trauma in the past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met my ex online, the norm for me because it&amp;#39;s simple to dismiss people, harsh I know but I&amp;#39;m above average in the looks department and the attention can become overwhelming. I met him after a painful break-up, determined to be just friends because I really didn&amp;#39;t need a boyfriend at that moment, we hung out and it was easy, it was fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the issues began well before I met him, my choice of partner had been erratic due to a severe breakup at 18. I avoided that personality type because it was also the personality type of my father who passed away. I have always been okay with the mirror of my Dad, I&amp;#39;m just like him and knew that I worked best with someone like me. It&amp;#39;s less about &amp;quot;Daddy issues&amp;quot; and more about complimenting personality.  Anyway, I met my ex, and with a combination of people telling me &amp;#39;he was the type to settle down with&amp;#39; and  &amp;#39;this was love because it was calm, dependable&amp;#39;. That he &amp;#39;would look after me&amp;#39; (not that I was ever really reliant on men but I aimed to be a mother and wanted the financial stability) and I could help him be a better person. He wanted to be a better person, after years of childhood trauma, he wanted to be kind, outgoing and not angry all the time and I, the idiot with a hero complex decided sure, that was a great idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I committed. I committed to this angry, damaged man who worshipped me like the sun because I was pretty, smart and kind. What I didn&amp;#39;t understand was that people who don&amp;#39;t know how to love, communicate and reciprocate compromise will drain you. Our sex life was dull, I&amp;#39;d always had a high sex drive but with him, it was lacking, I figured this was a good thing because the guys who were great at sex had only ever disappointed me, the pretty guys had only ever made me feel regret at giving them a chance. This was me, still reeling from the previous relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years passed, we got married, we made plans to have kids, we brought a house and had a nice car. We had THE life, we had the life that everyone aspired too. We seemed great from the outside, happy with a solid friendship and time passed unassumingly. From the inside, I was alone most of the time. He worked away five days a week and the more he was away the more I resented him at home. We spent time in separate rooms doing separate things because it was easier. We never spent any time together really and I suppose that should have been one of a million little red flags. There were things I let go for an easy life, like not demanding his time off, letting him spend it with his friends, gaming or yet more work because he needed it. Relinquishing time to let him stay at work longer than he needed to because he saw it as necessary, though he could have been spending time with me. I never bitched, never fought it because I&amp;#39;d replace him in my life with other people. If I wanted to go to the spa I called my mother. The theatre? A friend. Drinks? Another friend and so on until the only things we did together were things he wanted to do. We only ate where he was happy too, only did sports, watched movies, listened to music that he wanted to and I let it happen because it was easier. Essentially, we were living sperate lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking point came last year. My contraception had come to its natural end and so we decided it would be a good time to have kids, (I know, it&amp;#39;s insane). January came, I relinquished my safety net and left it to nature. It took eight months of spiralling depression, anxiety and wishing for my period every month for me to realise that this just wasn&amp;#39;t for me. I&amp;#39;m not sure what finally did it, maybe reading something online or something someone said but I woke up. I realised, that not only could I not stay like this any more, but that I missed sex, great passionate sex, I missed life. Somewhere along the line, I&amp;#39;d buried parts of myself away because they didn&amp;#39;t fit in with the &amp;#39;Lifestyle&amp;#39; I thought I wanted. I realised that actually I&amp;#39;d never wanted kids, I liked the idea, I was great with them but I absolutely didn&amp;#39;t want one myself. I called my ex and told him and his response was &amp;#39;Well what if I want them?&amp;#39; and my only recourse was &amp;#39;Find someone else then because it won&amp;#39;t be with me.&amp;#39; That was the beginning of the end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having kids to me had always been the end goal, even though looking back it had never been my dream. Get married, have kids, have a house, it was the heteronormative dream and I fell for it. I was relieved, ecstatic at my decision and eager to get back on contraception which I did within twenty-four hours. From there we tried, we opened our marriage, we talked, we cried and eventually we split, knowing that we probably should never have gone past a friendship at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been amicable for the most part. He&amp;#39;s grown a lot while with me and I hope some of that sticks but I can&amp;#39;t be sure it will. The truth is he&amp;#39;s married to his job, he loves it, it defines him and I think that&amp;#39;s because his job can&amp;#39;t hurt him as people can. I realised that he was never emotionally available, I needed someone who will let their walls down. I was never happy being what was essentially a housewife. I&amp;#39;d chosen a role that I thought I needed and he chose the thing he loved most. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks, this chapter of my life will be closed and I can officially begin the new one with my new, child-free boyfriend. I&amp;#39;m gloriously happy, I see now what I could have had, what I should have heald out for and I feel sad for the person I used to be.

,Divorce,"Hello all,
After 7 years of being married to an angry person, I've finally said enough. Our dating, engagement and marriage was done fairly quickly (from meeting to altar, 15 months). I had no idea what he was truly like until the day we got married. I hadn't dated much before him and was naive about the importance of giving ourselves the time we needed to really get to know each other. It's been hellish to say the least. We've been in individual therapy and couples therapy. He's made big changes and has been trying. I'm proud of his efforts, but I'm so tired. I'm tired of being stifled, stepped on, nit picked, etc. We really do not have enough in common to even carry a conversation and the fact is that I can't be myself with him and I don't feel safe to come out of my shell for long enough to actually do the major healing work that needs to happen. I don't think there is enough therapy in the world to help two people so utterly unsuited for each other, and I don't want to spend the rest of my life with someone I have to try SO HARD with to understand and to be understood. And in all honesty, I simply do not want to work it out or be with him any longer.

I finally had ""the talk"" with him last night. We have an almost 4 year old. 

I'm feeling a mixture of sadness and utter relief. My husband is a hot mess. But he has accepted what I've said and heard me. Unfortunately, I'm a completely dependent homemaker. I haven't had a job since I was pregnant with my kid. I have family that I can go to, but they are a solid 6 hours away in a different state. I am dependent on my husband's income and insurance. He has made it clear that I have financial support for as long as I need it. He is an angry person, but he isn't vindictive and I trust his word in this matter.
Our biggest concern is our kid. If I go, it will be a huge change for him since I am his caregiver 100% except for a few hours a week for preschool. My husband is an AMAZING father. He has helped with our kid from day one. He is a shitty husband, but seriously the best dad. Right now, we are just going to try to take baby steps for the sake of the child. Which brings me to my questions for this sub:

• Is it possible to separate while still living together (sleeping in separate rooms, going into a roomates type situation)?
• is it possible to go through the legalities of separation and divorce while still living together?
• we are planning on doing a ""relationship contract"" to lay out clear boundaries for both of us to make living together easier (i.e. He doesn't get to comment on how I spend my time, clean house, etc and lay out clear expectations of daily household stuffs etc)
• Are there some resources (books/websites) that can give solid information about how to make this transition the least traumatizing for a small child?

I also want to make it clear that I am not in any kind of danger. Like I said before he is an angry person but not vindictive or violent. I've definitely experienced some emotional abuse and gaslighting over the course of the relationship, but those things are very rare these days as I've learned to look for them and put a stop to them quickly. He has always been quick to recognize his wrong and to try to make amends. 

I know that no matter what this whole thing is painful and messy. But my kid won't grow up with their parents shouting at each other day and night. As a child of divorce, I know it fucks you up, but there is healing and understanding that comes in time. 

Thanks for reading and for any wisdom you can offer.

Bear with me... my case is heavy. I will not say the exact numbers as to somewhat hide who I am. The reason I am writing is for a very specific question (see below for a background) :

* Do I need to give spouse support to a spouse who will be living outside Canada. She will be living with a boyfriend based on the fact that she got pregnant (100% not mine) by that guy.

Background

* Canadian man around 40 (me) married with a Chinese mid 30 with Permanent residency, 2 (Canadian) kids (around 9)
* Between 10-15 years of marriage
* We (had) a house and still have a condo
* It was an horrible marriage: 
   * Controlling : ""do what I say, not what I do""; 
   * Lazy ""housewife"" who washes cloth once every 3 weeks, do a quick meal once per day (rice + whatever), etc.
   * Always screaming at my son, even beating him. Destroying anything he might like (a book, Pokemon cards, etc.) because he did not ""obey fast enough"".
   * Never her fault, drilled that into my head by stopping me from sleeping while I had to deal with 2 jobs
   * Somewhat recently, she has pain while walking, \*all\* her excuses to whatever happen is somewhat related to this (leaving details)
* Divorce started at the end of last year with a \*lot\* of problems afterward :
   * A mediator has been tried, it was a mess. She was too busy to make sure the mediator knew that she was the ""victim"" rather than trying to find a solution. At that time, she kept using the kids to make me lose my patience (asking them directly ""do you want to be with father or mother"", etc. etc.)
   * Forced out of my house because I stopped her from doing something stupid, she called the police. She had a criminal case opened, it was dropped by the court attorney. (leaving out the details on this)
   * So, for more than 6 months, I lived at a friend's place in a small room, barely saw my kids, no money because I had to keep paying the house &amp; condo &amp; her services &amp; food &amp; etc.
   * The house sale was a \*lot\* of stress...
      * I had to clean the whole place by myself during the visits I had to see my kids....
      * A few days before the visit at the notary for the sale, she was refusing to sign..... she finally did
* The basis of the divorce is the above, but she had a selfish reason for making my life hell. She always had an escape path of going back to China and hooking back with someone she met just before our wedding. Which she did, now she is pregnant.
* Emotionally, I think I am healed. Though, I do seem to have problems having a deep feeling for someone else.

,Divorce,"So, I'd love some input from those of you who lived something like that...

My wife left me three months and a half ago. We have for boys (2 to 11). She admitted to an emotional affair, then put me in competition with the AP for six weeks. She blamed me. She changed her mind every three day regarding whether she gave us a chance or not, while I was dancing the pick me dance. Then she finally decided to leave me, after destroying me psychologically. She never asked forgiveness for that. She did for other things but not that. Ok so I've told that story already.

I've been helped wonderfully by three common friends that we have. I really owe them. But they don't want to judge or pick sides. And I may have read chumplady.com too much (figure of speech, I really dig this website) but I'm starting having issues with their choice not too choose.

&lt;p&gt;My wife left me three months and a half ago. We have for boys (2 to 11). She admitted to an emotional affair, then put me in competition with the AP for six weeks. She blamed me. She changed her mind every three day regarding whether she gave us a chance or not, while I was dancing the pick me dance. Then she finally decided to leave me, after destroying me psychologically. She never asked forgiveness for that. She did for other things but not that. Ok so I&amp;#39;ve told that story already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been helped wonderfully by three common friends that we have. I really owe them. But they don&amp;#39;t want to judge or pick sides. And I may have read chumplady.com too much (figure of speech, I really dig this website) but I&amp;#39;m starting having issues with their choice not too choose.

,Divorce,"So I'll try to be brief and get to the important stuff.

I've been married for 2 years, and have been in a relationship with this girl for 3 years in total (including the married time).

I'm 28 years old, and she's 36.  Things seemed smooth for awhile, and we had some kind of connection, or so I thought. These days I'm not sure what to think anymore. I feel lost, and full of confusion. I contemplate ending it, and other times I think things will be better.  We don't connect much anymore, or talk for that matter.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue 1:  My wife has this annoying habit of not listening to me when I speak, or interrupting me and talking over me. I find it very annoying and I've tried so many times to express that to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue 2: She is very high strung,  and finds fault in everything that happens and/or everything I do.  She is one of those people that talks loud and so frantic that it seems like a blur of tension unloading. The bad part is it never ends. She finds a way to complain about every thing and obsesses over it for what seems like eternity.  The wind is blowing in the wrong direction. Her hair is messed up and it'll never look right, even after 3-4 hours of messing with it. Oh, don't get me started on gifts. I try to be nice and surprise her with stuff, just to hear ""I don't like this, it's tacky, mmm yeah no I don't like it"". No matter what it is, she finds a way to make it into a disaster.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue 3: I have anxiety issues, and feel over worked. I work 6 days a week and put in about 54-60 hours a week at my job. I frequently have anxiety attacks and it takes a lot of work for me to not let it get to me. I used to have outlets, playing music, working out, hanging with friends, but I don't have that anymore it feels like. Not to mention she doesn't respect my problems. She just thinks it's not real? Or maybe she doesn't care. But  when I bring it up that her actions make my anxiety worse, she doesn't listen or respond just keeps going on in her rampages.

I can't do anything because it's ""oh you're not paying attention to me well fuck whatever then""

&amp;#x200B;

OR ""You've been out all night guess we aren't eating dinner then, thanks""

&amp;#x200B;

I used to hear that a lot back when I would go to martial arts class. Which is only a couple of hours at night, once a week!

&amp;#x200B;

Issue 4: We have no sex. It's not all her fault, I know she has thyroid problems, and is trying to help that. But we still don't do anything sexual.  We used to have sex maybe 1 or 2 times a month. Now? Maybe once every few months if not longer. It's frustrating, now more than ever, because I just kinda gave up on caring about it. Our sex wasn't ever really that great to begin with though to be honest.

We never exchanged oral, even when I offered to go down on her, she just doesn't like doing anything other than missionary.

&amp;#x200B;

Which sounds great at this point, since i'm kinda stuck jacking myself off in the bathroom.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue 5:

&amp;#x200B;

She' doesn't help me with any of the bills or with anything around the apartment. I do the laundry, I do the shopping, I do the cleaning, I do the cooking, and everything else you can think of I freaking do it.

&amp;#x200B;

She works part time, I understand she doesn't have a  lot of money, but she could at least do something around the apartment or help me out. 

&amp;#x200B;

ANyways,  I needed to rant this out. I have no one really to talk to about this, and I feel closed in. I had  a full blown panic meltdown at work Saturday and nearly passed out, ended up in the hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore, or maybe I'm just too scared of change?

&amp;#x200B;

I am burned out on everything, and I just want to live my life in peace and have fun like I used to.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I even sometimes think maybe I could find a girl that feels the same out in the world, that would like that too. To have fun, and laugh and love and enjoy each other, not pick fights or harp on someone and disrespect them all the time, when all I do is be nice and work hard.

&amp;#x200B;

There is great advice in multiple posts within this subreddit, but I'd like to invite specific advice for my mother's situation.  Here is some context and specific questions:

&amp;#x200B;

* Age: 58.  Length of marriage: 12 years.  Three kids (all adults).  Owns a house with STBX.  Each have own personal vehicle.
* Consulted an attorney, who made a few recommendations on how to proceed.  
* Separating from STBX because of emotional abuse and irreconcilable differences.
* Mother is highly nervous about the process and her STBX's reaction to the news, once delivered.  STBX has been physically violent in the past, and is easily angered.  A strong, angry reaction by STBX is anticipated by both my mother and myself.
* Specific questions that we'd like to answer:

1. How/what should my mother prepare before delivering the news to her STBX?
2. Is it better to give one's STBX notice (days, weeks) before moving out, or is it better to surprise the STBX and move out ASAP?  My mother is cordial and fair, but considering her STBX's personality this could jeopardize her possessions.
3. Who should be present for my mother's move-out - friends, family, a moving company, or all of the above?
4. Is it appropriate to consult law enforcement, considering my mother's STBX's background?
5. What else should my mother be considering for the process?

He left our oldest daughter home alone once when she was 8 or 9 months old so he could go buy cigarettes without hassling with the car seat.

To be honest, I don't want to get on here to bash my wife but I am in a spot where I am just done. She has a really abusive childhood that she just will not recognize or work on getting over. I have pushed for her to seek counseling but she has only ever tried twice before and would just stop going. She is just filled with negativity and constantly tells me how bad she has it and is constantly in a state of blame dodging. 

There is too many things to really list off but I just can't do it anymore. I made the choice to improve my life and really evaluated what was making me so miserable. In doing so, I've realized that my wife is my main source of anxiety. Whenever I'm not around her, I'm a fun person and love to joke around but as soon as she gets near I just shut down. I've been told things in the past like she has a hidden hand written suicide note. Or if I left her then she would take the girls and go live in section 8 housing. 

I've realized that what I have been doing for the past year or two is just going through the motions to avoid fights with her. I no longer know if I mean it when I tell her I love her. I give her a good night kiss not because I want to but because I want to avoid the fight. 

I start my first counselling session tomorrow. I hope to find something to get me through this. I don't know what to think anymore. I've been told for so long that I'm the crazy one for so long that I wonder if this is all gaslighting from her. All I know is that I am done.

Where I get confused is this. Am I doing the right thing if I officially end it? Is my happiness worth putting my daughters through whatever hell awaits? For so long I have had the mindset of staying together for the kids but I don't know if I can do it myself anymore. She isn't a drug addict, she isn't an alcoholic, I have no infidelity suspicions. But how long can a person live a life where everything is bad and nothing works out? How can someone live a life where no positivity exists? Is this something worth splitting with the mother of my kids with? Past actions have proved to me that she is not and will not seek help.

,Divorce,"Married 18 years, together 20. F44. Two kids. Still in shock, so I am sure to ramble...

First off, I had an affair while I was taking a certain antidepressant. Before the affair, I was wildly craving one, but not addressing the fact that I was married, and wasn't really into sex, then suddenly I realized I still had a sex drive, but not for him.

So, I withdrew from him, because any slightest sign of affection from me would result in him making some kind of move, that I didn't really want. 

So, in a sense, the affair woke me up to the fact that I had grown apart from my husband, and that I still had a shot at finding a better fit for me and for him.

For the record, my husband is a CATCH. He is handsome, smart, funny, in great shape, and probably one of the nicest people there is. There is really no logical reason for me not to be madly in love with him. But that's how I feel. 

So, I told him in therapy this afternoon that I don't see us as an old couple going on walks and holding hands. I just won't be happy that way. 

And I feel like this is me being assertive for the first time in what seems like forever.

Both my husband and I are terrified of traumatizing the kids. We will definitely be partners in raising the kids (11 &amp; 13) with as little stress from this as possible. I also told my husband that I value his friendship, so I hope that we can still be friends. He is angry right now, but I can guarantee that he will find someone infinitely  more suited to him than me. And he will be happier than he has been for a long time. And I think I will too.

Would love words of advice, encouragement, and support. I already know ITA for having the affair, when I should have addressed this long before it.

Edit: Thanks for your responses. I'd like to clarify that this wasn't about the sex. The ""craving"" was due to the mania I was experiencing at the time. Some antidepressants cause people do demonstrate risky behavior, like gambling. This is how it manifested in me. I was just too fucked in the head to realize that's what it was. Call me any name in the book if it makes you feel better. I've heard all of them.

Also, this happened a few years ago, I've been emotionally destroyed by this, as this friend was one of my best friends, but I think I'm ready to share it.

I had a friend (f) which I knew since we were kids, we always loved spending time together as friends. She had this one boyfriend, which I didn't like, but she said she was kind of trapped with him. (She didn't really like him but felt trapped.) I told her she should leave him, but she said it'll get better. I trusted her, which is a mistake that still bothers me to this day. A few months og by, and now they're getting married. She hadn't really complained anymore or Anything, so I thought everything was going good. Fastfoward another month, and they're married. Everytime I see her with him, she seems scared, like he's gonna kill her anymoment. I always ask her what's wrong, as att his point, she can cry at any moment for no reason. I told her to tell me, but she told me everything was ok. Another year has passed now, and she finally files for divorce. I knew something was wrong, and I'm happy she's getting out of it. They finally get divorced after so long because of the guy dragging it for so long. One day, a week after the divorce, I asked if she wanted to ahng out at a cafe, she declined. I thought nothing of it, maybe she was busy was my thoughts. The Next day I find out she comitted suicide. I couldn't believe it. I kept myself in my room talking to no one and just crying. After I finally got to stop crying and try to live my life, I learned why she did it. Under the divorce, the guy's Family had harassed her and told her that if she ever tries to get help or talk of this to anyone, she'd make sure her Family would get driven to hell. Since she didn't want her Family to be harmed, she just kept all of this to herself. When she finally got divorced, they did the same thing to her, just far worse, they started sending death threats, and saying they'll harm her family if she talks to anyone of this. I always think of her, and I still cry when I think about what happened. She never got to have a kid of her own, never even reached the age of 30....Why is this world so cruel?

,Divorce,"Sunday morning.  A woman I am dating just left.  I felt anxious last night and this morning. Didn't sleep well. I have known her since late April.  Been sort of on and off and she is at a similar place as me in terms of growth and self help and trying to learn more about how to relate.  She's been willing to live in the uncertainty and knows that I'm still processing the divorce (she also ended a 3 year relationship just before we met; not a marriage and they did not fully live together; she has no kids and is 41 and I'm 51).  She's great.  I'm not sure I'm 100% physically attracted to her (she is attractive but not the normal type I go for, which is fine, really, and can be a sign of growth, since my ex is my type and that didn't work out).  I have been very honest with this person and she is honest with me.  

I am not sure why I am still processing the end of the marriage.  It's been a year and a month since my STBXW said she wanted a divorce, and she has been so clear since then.  No signs of hope.  No dragging it out.  We relate but only with regard to kids.  Minimal contact.  We're still negotiating a separation agreement and that looms in the background, and it's stressful for both us.  It will be done done soon and I think it will be good when it is.  I am a bit anxious about the financial portion.  I try to stay present and in the moment but with two kids there is a serious obligation on my end. I will make it work but I do worry that I'll be drained in 15 years and that this will impact my retirement.  Such is life, but it's a cause of stress.

Ex has a boyfriend and seems happy, centered, done and moved on with her life.  She's financially stable and owned our home so she has that.  If she has struggled with this at all I've not seen it.  I realize as the initiator she processed this for a while BEFORE announcing the divorce.  I get all that.  I get that she was done and it's over.  I'm still however having a hard time getting to the fully letting go point.  And I don't know why.  Cannot tell if it's genuine emotions that will just take more time to recede or if it's ego and an unhealthy attachment.  My belief is that the issues we had were resolvable.  But I did not live the marriage through her eyes.  She disagrees.  And of course if she is done it is done.  In some ways it should be easy b/c, logically, I recognize there is no hope or chance. I just don't understand where these feelings come from. 

If you read my post history you'll see that I am TRYING to do all the right things, to work on myself:  new hobbies, renewed commitment to exercise and eating well, learning to love myself, lots of therapy, lots of reading of books on self improvement, doing things outside my comfort zone.

It's working but here I am, still needing support.  Even something as benign as an email from my ex asking to switch a day can trigger some pain....Seeing her name, first off, and then having her and knowing it means she has a plan with her boyfriend she wants to keep.

I get that she was done and it&amp;#39;s over.  I&amp;#39;m still however having a hard time getting to the fully letting go point.  And I don&amp;#39;t know why.  Cannot tell if it&amp;#39;s genuine emotions that will just take more time to recede or if it&amp;#39;s ego and an unhealthy attachment.  My belief is that the issues we had were resolvable.  But I did not live the marriage through her eyes.  She disagrees.  And of course if she is done it is done.  In some ways it should be easy b/c, logically, I recognize there is no hope or chance. I just don&amp;#39;t understand where these feelings come from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read my post history you&amp;#39;ll see that I am TRYING to do all the right things, to work on myself:  new hobbies, renewed commitment to exercise and eating well, learning to love myself, lots of therapy, lots of reading of books on self improvement, doing things outside my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s working but here I am, still needing support.  Even something as benign as an email from my ex asking to switch a day can trigger some pain....Seeing her name, first off, and then having her and knowing it means she has a plan with her boyfriend she wants to keep.  We are committed to being great co parents, so of course I am flexible.  But it all still hurts.  The knowledge she has a boyfriend should be all I need to fully move on, but I&amp;#39;m not.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Hey guys,

My wife has suggested 6 months to see other people with the option of being sexually actively so she can figure out if I’m who she wants to be with.

She was recently caught in an inappropriate situation with her previous boss which lands us here. She was texting constantly with reasonable innuendo and discussions of plans to meet behind my back. 

My take on this is that she wants me to continue bankrolling her while she looks for someone. I make 2.5 times what she does and she had a bad spending habit so she would be in trouble without my income.

I need to grow a pair and cut it off but hypothetically when does the alimony accrual clock stop? Is it as soon as we file or is it once it’s finalized?

,Divorce,"I'll keep this brief because the question is broad and I just need to know where to go from here. Not even sure if it's better suited here or in Relationship Advice so I apologise if I've picked the wrong subreddit.

I've been married for almost 10 years, never had a serious relationship before her, we have two kids together and while the divorce is basically mutual (we’re still friends, co-parent well etc..) I feel like once it finally ends I’m going to be lost. She's going to be okay, she'll bounce back and find someone else if she wants, she has a great career, plenty of friends and family for support, etc. She’ll naturally keep the house and kids too as the bread winner...Hell, she seems happier already knowing that it’s ending soon. I’m happy for her, but I am silently terrified for myself.

I just don't know what happens now. I’ve got no career, no money to my name, no friends that we didn’t “share”. My family aren’t even in the same country.

I’ve just been a stay at home dad/house husband since we moved in together. For a decade everything I've done has been building towards that future of just being a family man. Without that, what now? 

It feels like such a stupid question but I can't see the next step, it feels like I’ve missed so many key steps to being a single adult, nothing is in place and I’m starting 10 years late. 

Am I meant to try to find another partner? Do I just stay single?.. I can’t imagine being with anyone else, and certainly cannot even begin to imagine how I’d go about finding that someone else. Tinder…that seems horrific from what I've seen online, and I’m socially awkward as it is, so a chance encounter at a pub/club is unlikely at best. What other choices are there?

Even if we ignore the relationship side of things, am I meant to start a career now? Do I go back to school to train for something? Is it too late?.. For the last 6 years I’ve had a (very low paying) stay at home contracting job, but there’s really nowhere higher to go than my current position there and it’s not really a passion. It’d be enough to keep me going, rent a little place etc.. But then what?

So…enough rambling. Anyone got any advice? Or care to vent tooso I know I’m not the only one who has been in this situation?

Just to make it clear, none of this is meant to be overly dramatic. I’m not writing this with tears in my eyes or considering ending it all, and I certainly don’t think I deserve pity. I'm just genuinely not sure what I am supposed to do now and was hoping others may have felt similarly and can share some insights.

,Divorce,"Apologies in advance if I get some of the lingo wrong, relatively knew to this. I'm currently in the process of a divorce in the UK. It's really hard and sometimes it csn all feel like too much. To give some context this is a (brief) overview of what has brought me to this point.

When I was a teenager one of the leaders at my church put me through Sexuality Conversion Therapy. I knew I was attracted to guys, but got put through that so thought I'd always be single. When I was 19 I got married to the only woman I fell in love with. My mental health has always been a difficulty bu about a year ago I had a mental breakdown and tried to kill myself because of all the damage caused by the Sexuality Conversion Therapy. Then a fee month's ago in the middle of my recovery my STBX cheated on me multiple times and then dumped me. I ended up with no fixed home, I was in the process of preparing to go to University for the first time (at 26!) and trying to piece my wellbeing back together. Since then I have started dating and because I am dating a guy a chunk of my family have kicked me to the curb.

Due to everything I have been through I have cycles of quite strong depression, anxiety and mild symptoms of PTSD. I have lost people I thought were friends, I have lost family, I lost my home, I lost my wife and I lost my role as a husband.

Yet. This morning, I woke up next to my boyfriend, with my dog, in my bed. I am living in one of my best friends attics. I am at university studying, making friends. This evening I am having friends round for film and food. I am cooking, eating, studying, working. There is hope. It does get better. When I was 14, I thought I'd never have a boyfriend. That I'd never be happy with a guy. When I found out my ex was cheating on me I thought I'd never be loved or attractive again. Yet here I am.

I was the one who said I wanted a divorce but my husband’s (24, m) mom is the one who forced him to file right away. I would’ve been open to being separated, but he listens to his mom about everything and she took him to the courthouse.

I mean, I know now that we weren’t supposed to be together. We got pregnant with our son (1 yr old) after a month of being together, and we were on and off for almost two years. Our marriage only lasted eight weeks. And, I know it seems rushed but I really did love my husband, from our first date I knew he was the one for me. But, he has addiction issues, super codependent on his mother, and we’ve been physical with each other.

Well, I accept it because I know for me and my son it’s better that we aren’t together. It would have been hell for my kid growing up. But, the part I don’t know how to handle is the actual process. His mother has been writing all of the motions, and just has him sign his name. Her concern is taking my son from me. She isn’t thinking about safety issues with his father or her household. 

They have lied in their motion, saying I’m “physically abusive, compulsive liar, alienating our son, left the state after being told I couldn’t (which we did not leave), and just a whole bunch of other lies. My husband has taken everything from us, the car, furniture, etc. he broke into our apartment multiple times to remove these things, and I ended up giving him the car (both names on title) because his family started driving by my parents house late at night. He even wanted to take the baby’s crib and stroller so he could sell them. But I put my foot down with that one.

We were doing visits at the park, but every time we would visit, the next time his mother would serve me with a new motion. So I was advice to end it, unless required to have visits for our son.  We went to mediation, but the mediator pulled me aside because even though we were reaching agreements, she was concerned that husband was high, and she said she would make notes. Well, she made notes but they mentioned nothing about him being high, which is like wtf? Which brings my to my next concern, I live in a pretty racist state...my husband is white and I’m mixed, I’m afraid that they’ll use that against me. For ex, he even got away with yelling in my face inside the court room, was asked to step outside, and when I walked out he proceeded to yell in my face, and the cop that was in the room did nothing to stop him (he was literally a foot away, watching).

So, I finally got a lawyer, which is good. But I’m just so terrified that they will grant some sort of custody to my husband. And, that is too much for me to handle.

Some background: every year I present at a national professional academic conference which is in different cities far from where I live. This year it is in Florida. Before I knew we were getting a divorce, I already submitted a proposal to do a 1-hour presentation which was accepted. I was excited about it at the time, but now it is coming up next month and my anxiety is through the roof about leaving our four year old son with my STBX for nearly a week while I go to the conference. Every year I feel nervous about leaving him and every year it has been fine, but this year is different because my STBX has left me, we are separated, going to get a divorce, and now my ex has a lawyer and he won’t even talk to me directly anymore—he asks that I make any requests of him in writing by text or email. How can I leave my young son whom I love more than anyone with a man who is treating me this way, and frankly doesn’t have good mental health? Also, I have never been to my ex’s new apartment, nor met his roommates. When I first talked with my ex about taking him that week after we’d agreed to the divorce I did it thinking we’d still have a friendly speaking relationship and I’d eventually get to see his new apartment, etc. But now the relationship with my STBX has deteriorated further. How can I leave my child with him? Should I make alternate arrangements for childcare? Should I stay home from the conference? I would never get over it if I entrusted my child to this man I hardly even feel like I know anymore and he was harmed in some way. I know no one can reassure me for sure without knowing my ex, but I guess I’d like to know especially from the divorced guys on here what is out of line for an ex wife to request or do in this situation and what is a reasonable request or safeguard so I can go participate in the conference without worrying constantly about my son?

More background: my ex has never been physically abusive, but I feel he has been emotionally and verbally abusive to me, which I no longer tolerate, which is why he no longer speaks to me; he thinks I’m unable or unwilling to hear any justified criticism of myself, calling that verbal abuse, but I feel he crosses the line past constructive criticism with me, so I stopped allowing him to talk to me that way now that we are getting a divorce (which he initiated). I don’t have a lawyer yet but I know I need to get one, we have an informal parenting plan agreed to through mediation but haven’t filed yet, my ex has depression and has threatened suicide before to manipulate me, never threatened to or physically harmed our son but does use shame-inducing talk when our son misbehaves or makes a clumsy mistake, and he externalizes and blames me for 100% of our marriage problems.",t2_11hkkj,False,,0,False,Building anxiety about leaving son with STBX when I go to a multi-day conference,[],r/Divorce,False,1,,0,False,t3_dh6j07,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1570973484.0,text,1,,text,self.Divorce,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m probably just stressing myself out unnecessarily here, but my mind is leaping to the most unpleasant places.

My time over the last couple of months has gone to the mourning process, trying to understand the whys and what ifs and hows of when I lost the love of my life. Yet, the reality is, he chose to go. He is gone, on his way to a new life that will give him everything he believes that he needs.

During this time, my heartbreak has taken over and left me helpless, unable to peel myself off the floor. Unable to keep the tears from flowing like a river down my face. At times, I can’t breathe, I have let myself slip into this darkness.

Yet, here I am, standing. Not because I am strong, but because I have surrounded myself with beautiful people. People who have pulled me up from these feelings of worthlessness. People who have not let me forget that life can be beautiful. That there is light to be found.

,Divorce,"She held up our custody agreement for months and tried to claim I was dangerous because I'm an alcoholic and drug addict. One reason I left was I couldn't stay sober in the relationship which was very codependent, I and needed to get back into recovery. Anyone who has ever left a codependent relationship knows that there's no worse betrayal to the person being left than ending the codependence. she told me for months when I tried to talk to her about separating that if I ever left her she would turn my kids against me and ruin my life. I stayed way too long for fear of what she would. I see now that was just emotional terrorism and I'm grateful I finally left all she's done is show her ass and act out and none of it has worked. She even went so far as to ask friends to testify in custody court against me. No one would. It was pure projection.

She finally agreed to 50/50 custody which is what I was asking for. Now months later she's going out all the time and drinking a lot. Leaving them with babysitters when I'm more than happy to take them extra. She's got a profile on seeking arrangements.com which certainly makes sense considering how she treated me in the relationship. we're still not divorced after a year and a half because she won't settle for anything less than I get none of our retirement accounts, which is ridiculous. So it's slowly winding it's way too trial. I know the judge is absolutely gonna roast her for refusing to settle over the amount of money that we're talking about but that's cold comfort at the moment. Thankfully she's not bringing any of the sugar daddies around my kids.

I'm doing really well though. I'm trying not to develop a resentment here. I know that won't help things. I go to meetings  I have a sponsor  I go to therapy and I'm unraveling all the years of childhood sexual and emotional abuse I suffered from my mother that caused me to become an addict and an alcoholic in the first place. I take the kids to therapy. I'm doing my part. I'm just really scared. I watched my mom deteriorate when I was a kid and my parents got divorced and she did all the same things. Yes I know I married a woman that was a lot like my mom. Hence the therapy lol.

One reason I left was I couldn&amp;#39;t stay sober in the relationship which was very codependent, I and needed to get back into recovery. Anyone who has ever left a codependent relationship knows that there&amp;#39;s no worse betrayal to the person being left than ending the codependence. she told me for months when I tried to talk to her about separating that if I ever left her she would turn my kids against me and ruin my life. I stayed way too long for fear of what she would. I see now that was just emotional terrorism and I&amp;#39;m grateful I finally left all she&amp;#39;s done is show her ass and act out and none of it has worked. She even went so far as to ask friends to testify in custody court against me. No one would. It was pure projection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She finally agreed to 50/50 custody which is what I was asking for. Now months later she&amp;#39;s going out all the time and drinking a lot. Leaving them with babysitters when I&amp;#39;m more than happy to take them extra. She&amp;#39;s got a profile on seeking arrangements.com which certainly makes sense considering how she treated me in the relationship. we&amp;#39;re still not divorced after a year and a half because she won&amp;#39;t settle for anything less than I get none of our retirement accounts, which is ridiculous. So it&amp;#39;s slowly winding it&amp;#39;s way too trial. I know the judge is absolutely gonna roast her for refusing to settle over the amount of money that we&amp;#39;re talking about but that&amp;#39;s cold comfort at the moment. Thankfully she&amp;#39;s not bringing any of the sugar daddies around my kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m doing really well though. I&amp;#39;m trying not to develop a resentment here. I know that won&amp;#39;t help things. I go to meetings  I have a sponsor  I go to therapy and I&amp;#39;m unraveling all the years of childhood sexual and emotional abuse I suffered from my mother that caused me to become an addict and an alcoholic in the first place. I take the kids to therapy. I&amp;#39;m doing my part. I&amp;#39;m just really scared. I watched my mom deteriorate when I was a kid and my parents got divorced and she did all the same things. Yes I know I married a woman that was a lot like my mom. Hence the therapy lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there&amp;#39;s nothing I can do about it other than be a source of stability and safety for them.

,Divorce,"So this will be long, just to warn you :-)

My husband (40) and I (42/f) have been together for 16 years, married for 13. Love at first sight. Two strong girls 11 and 8. We've built an incredible life together. We love each other. Still kissed all the time, complemented each other, appreciated each other. Had tons of fun. Laughed a lot. When we were connected. Pulling from the same side of the rope as I like to think of it. 

The problem was that he gets very defensive and shuts down fairly regularly. When he's like this he sees me (or whoever offended him, it's not just with me) totally differently and says hurtful things about me to make himself feel better. 

For the first 15 years of our relationship I always pulled him out of this state. We would talk and talk until he came back to his senses. 

So the rhythm of our relationship was dreamy fun, sexy, connected, flying high, until BAM, it would crash down. Then up again until BAM. Over and over and over. It was exhausting.

We've read marriage books at my urging and we've talked a lot about it, and we've definitely made improvements. Less things trigger him, than did in the past when I couldn't even ask him to help me with something when other people were around. Now we don't really have anything to fight about. Housework is fine, kids are fine, finances are fine.  

Unfortunately, the things he said when he was ""behind the wall,"" as I call it, got sharper and sharper toward the end of last year until my love tank was so full of holes that it just couldn't fill up anymore. I told him that I just couldn't do it anymore. That I could no longer be responsible for getting him to think clearly again, that it was his job. 

He had to decide if he even wanted to work on this stuff. I told him not everyone wants to grow, introspect and learn, and that I would respect him if he said it's just not for him. He assured me he wanted to, that he knows it would affect him in other parts of his life too, and he wanted to be free of it. He felt free and was excited about it.

In March he finally really got what I was talking about! Before that he'd only ever wanted to deal with the triggers and wasn't able to even understand what I meant when I encouraged him to dig into the mechanism of what happens when he closes up. But he saw it! He finally saw it! He thanked me for having been so patient and said that he was sorry for having hurt me so much and he wanted us to both start working on our relationship. That he was sorry it was just me for so long. He finally agreed to go to counseling. The hope and optimism I felt patched up the holes (I was sure that one he saw it he couldn't UN-see it) and I felt like things were going to be what I knew they could. 

Marriage counseling turned into individual counseling for him and he was writing things down and reflecting and things were so much better until he just stopped...and started backsliding. I suggested multiple times that he write things down. I told him I needed to see him actively working on things. But he just didn't. I didn't get it. A few weeks ago, when I finally had a real talk with him about it, he got defensive. Of course. I tried again, same thing. If peak awareness was in March at 100%, he was maybe at 10% awareness that there was even an issue. I was shattered. The patches of hope were blown to bits, and I told him I wanted to separate for a few months for him to decide on his own what he wants. After a few days it was so clear how behind the wall he was that I decided I needed a year. 

I want him to be standing solidly on his two emotional feet and decide if he even wants a marriage like I do. Last week when I write that I hope we can get through this and have a beautiful connected marriage he write ""I don't think a beautiful connected marriage is realistic, but a 'good' marriage should be."" I was gobsmacked. 

I don't have drama in my life and I'm not interested in it. I want loving, respectful connected relationships. I refuse to accept anything less from my marriage. 

I still hope he comes around, but after two weeks I have seen zero signs of it. No matter what, I know that we're exactly where we need to be and we'll end up wherever we should as well. 

We're talking on Monday (he doesn't want to write about his thoughts on our relationship) and I'm trying to stay balanced and solid so that I can hear what he has to say and stay reasonable and rational and protect myself. I haven't been drinking, I've been working out, getting good sleep.

We are now getting divorced (a long time coming), and she is trying to gain sole custody of our 3 children, with only supervised visitation, based solely on the fact that she doesn't want them around my ex, who I've recently began talking to (as friends, nothing more).

&lt;p&gt;We are now getting divorced (a long time coming), and she is trying to gain sole custody of our 3 children, with only supervised visitation, based solely on the fact that she doesn&amp;#39;t want them around my ex, who I&amp;#39;ve recently began talking to (as friends, nothing more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve already told her I&amp;#39;m willing to do 50/50 joint custody, no fuss from me. Now that she is beginning a pattern of pettiness involving my kids, I&amp;#39;m debating on still going for 50/50 or just straight for full custody. I honestly don&amp;#39;t want to take them from her completely, but I&amp;#39;m not going to be bullied out of seeing my kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, would the fact that she was arrested for DV play into my favor at all? Or does it&amp;#39;s dismissal negate it in the eyes of the court? &lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Two years ago I would dread coming home after work. Which wife would I receive today? The perky, happy wife who literally clung to my side or the abusive, hateful person I did not know. There was never a way of knowing. But the hateful version met me at home more and more.

But I feared the concept of divorce. I didn't want it. I would have given anything to prevent it. In fact, I gave a lot to fight against it.

But she gave up. She threw out my stuff and told me to live on the street. Soon she was public about a relationship she was in. She demanded a divorce.

I couldn't stop her. Why did things have to go this way? I was in denial about it all. Self-pity took root and soon bitterness.

,Divorce,"My parents divorced when i was 7, i’m 16 now, and i was put with my mom. I love my mom and we’re really close but i don’t like the family she married into AT ALL. They’re really petty/dramatic for adults.

Anyways that’s not the point, i’ve forced myself to adapt to it because I just can’t live with my dad. I feel like a burden when i’m at my dads house. But i don’t dislike the family he married into, like i dislike the family my mom married into. They’re really generous, nice, hard working people. Very admirable. Pretty much polar opposite to the family my mom married into. 

I know this because i used to visit my dad for days to weeks at a time, and when we did family stuff they were always really nice and made me feel included in the family. Then i got into a big fight with my dad over the stupidest shit. We stopped talking for months and maybe after 8 or so months i visited him again. Up until the fight i consistently visited him often since the divorce. It wasn’t the same when I came back. I just lost connection with the people there, obviously, because it was 8 months. However, even before the fight I always felt slightly awkward and out of place and like a burden but after it that feeling was just a million times worse. And i know it’s my fault so i’m not pinning it on them. 

Also, i know it’s stupid, but since they’re more conservative and sometimes talk down upon minorities including lgbt people (the only thing i don’t like about them) I feel uncomfortable. Because I know i’m not straight. Idk if i’m bisexual or fully gay yet, but that’s not the point. The point is, as apart of the lgbt community i definitely feel weird about being there because I’m out to my mom and friends and don’t care about telling people here at my moms because at least they’re supportive of the lgbt community. I just feel like it’s a bad idea to come out there, but it doesn’t matter because i feel too awkward being there in the first place so it’s not necessary. It just makes it worse, like on top of already feeling out of place i’m also queer which doesn’t help. I haven’t seen my dad since March or so because after the 8 months it’s just so painfully awkward and bad. I do nothing there and when family stuff happens i just don’t talk because i don’t know what to say and i feel bad about it. 

I guess what i’m hoping to get from posting this is reassurance or some sort or help. Well, i really don’t know what i’m trying to get out of posting this honestly. I just needed to post this somewhere because it’s been bugging the shit out of me since march. I don’t want to come off as an ungrateful kid who just hates his step family just because they’re step family. I actually like them. I just feel like i should leave them be and not be apart of their lives. I hate to say that, because I hate the idea of it. I just have tried to become apart of the family but the petty fight with my dad ruined it. I feel like i’m rambling at this point, so i’ll stop. Any type of help or whatever is seriously appreciated.

TL;DR: My dad married into a family that i never felt super close with, then after a fight and not seeing my dad for almost a year, I started seeing him again and i felt even more distanced. I like them all and think they’re great people and my dad is happy with them which is all that matters to me, but I feel out of place and as if I should just let them be and live my life on my own.

also i’m rlly nervous posting this pls don’t attack me 🥴

oh god didn’t mean for it to be this long sorry 💀",t2_2s52e7lq,False,,0,False,"i like the family my dad married into, but i feel like i should leave them alone?",[],r/Divorce,False,1,,0,False,t3_dgu7z3,False,light,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Child of Divorce,False,3,,,1570881904.0,,[],[],{},,True,,1570910366.0,text,1,,text,self.Divorce,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents divorced when i was 7, i’m 16 now, and i was put with my mom. I love my mom and we’re really close but i don’t like the family she married into AT ALL. They’re really petty/dramatic for adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways that’s not the point, i’ve forced myself to adapt to it because I just can’t live with my dad. I feel like a burden when i’m at my dads house. But i don’t dislike the family he married into, like i dislike the family my mom married into. They’re really generous, nice, hard working people. Very admirable. Pretty much polar opposite to the family my mom married into. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this because i used to visit my dad for days to weeks at a time, and when we did family stuff they were always really nice and made me feel included in the family. Then i got into a big fight with my dad over the stupidest shit. We stopped talking for months and maybe after 8 or so months i visited him again. Up until the fight i consistently visited him often since the divorce. It wasn’t the same when I came back. I just lost connection with the people there, obviously, because it was 8 months. However, even before the fight I always felt slightly awkward and out of place and like a burden but after it that feeling was just a million times worse. And i know it’s my fault so i’m not pinning it on them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, i know it’s stupid, but since they’re more conservative and sometimes talk down upon minorities including lgbt people (the only thing i don’t like about them) I feel uncomfortable. Because I know i’m not straight. Idk if i’m bisexual or fully gay yet, but that’s not the point. The point is, as apart of the lgbt community i definitely feel weird about being there because I’m out to my mom and friends and don’t care about telling people here at my moms because at least they’re supportive of the lgbt community. I just feel like it’s a bad idea to come out there, but it doesn’t matter because i feel too awkward being there in the first place so it’s not necessary. It just makes it worse, like on top of already feeling out of place i’m also queer which doesn’t help. I haven’t seen my dad since March or so because after the 8 months it’s just so painfully awkward and bad. I do nothing there and when family stuff happens i just don’t talk because i don’t know what to say and i feel bad about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what i’m hoping to get from posting this is reassurance or some sort or help. Well, i really don’t know what i’m trying to get out of posting this honestly. I just needed to post this somewhere because it’s been bugging the shit out of me since march. I don’t want to come off as an ungrateful kid who just hates his step family just because they’re step family. I actually like them. I just feel like i should leave them be and not be apart of their lives. I hate to say that, because I hate the idea of it.

,Divorce,"I've never sought advice or asked for  input on my nearly 13 year relationship with my partner, We met when we  were in our late teens and now in our early 30's we have reached a  point of such dysfunction that it seems futile to continue. To clarify  this is my only relationship experience as I was a late bloomer and  happened to find the ""perfect"" person at a young age (granted perfect  might be a bit of an exaggeration at this point)

Trust  has always been a challenge for my wife and in our early years I likely  didn't help, I'll admit I'm likely not the easiest of people to live  with and when I felt questioned my tenancy was to ""go dark"" and avoid  communication. I'm a bit of an odd duck and we live in a small country  with many options for employment so we have moved extensively (the  longest we were in one place was 1 year)

Years  passed and our relationship found a form of stability, from a very  early point my wife wanted to have children and in 2014 we had twin  boys. This actually strengthened us and lacking family support we dug in  and did our best to be parents, this was followed by our 3rd son in  late 2016 (who was born 10 days before we flew to the US for 3 months)  and our daughter in march of this year.

I  am outspoken, stubborn and quick to get distracted (I had a TBI when I  was in my early teens) and as such I've have had over 30 jobs until I  found my feet and went self employed, now in 2019 my business ventures  are taking off and our financial situation has never been better,  what  has changed is the amount of arguments between my wife and I, she is  constantly questioning who I am working with and suggesting all sorts of  unpleasant explanations for the time I spend away from the house (to be  clear this is not the usual ""we haven't had sex for months"" type of  deal, we are intimate daily (not boasting)) and in the last year she has  threatened to leave more times than I care to count. I have been doing  my best to put out fires and go so far as to share my live location and  even update her between meetings to ensure she is included in the  developments around the company.

In  the last week things have gone completely off the rails, late last week  she demanded to see my phone and spent over an hour reading through it  asking questions like ""what does this message mean"" ""you didn't tell me  you'd spoken to X"" I eventually lost my patience for this particular  exercise and got so far as starting the truck to head out for a drive  before she backed down.

This was  followed by consistent grilling and ""cross examination"" where I could  tell my wife was attempting to catch me in a lie (which turns out to be  really frustrating when you are actually being honest) and other such  pointless exercises in getting me to reveal ""the truth""

We  had moments of hope, she would suddenly change tact and start saying  ""you are right, I trust you"" and ""sometimes I'm just being stupid"" as a  way of apologising and many promises would follow to improve things and  get her head right.

Sadly this has  not lasted, she demanded to see my phone again and even used my  daughter waking and crying (our daughter has a soft spot for papa  cuddles) as an excuse to get me out of office so she could search  through my computer (with nothing found as there is nothing clandestine  to find) I have now pushed back and said no to any further examination  of my communication devices as its causing me too much stress.

Today  is Saturday, its been 7 days since this all kicked off and I have just  had enough, I have worked for 13 years on this relationship and I've  been the sole provider to my family for the past 5 years without ever  the thought of being unfaithful or doing anything to risk our  relationship, I have been transparent and open with her throughout and  in return I have gotten little but suspicion and doubt. I could barely  look at my children today and spent most of the day sleeping or staring  at my computer screen unable to work or relax.

Like  all long term relationships we have seen and done so much together that  its hard to contemplate life without her but I also know that if anyone  other than her treated me this way I would never speak to them again.

How do I start to dismantle this? what will my children think of me....

,Divorce,"EDIT:  Well, looks like I got somewhere.  She messaged me saying she wanted a divorce, so there it is.

She (29) asked for a separation from me (31) in September of last year after I had a very rough few years.  Several jobs... I quit some, got fired from some.  The death of my father.  Contemplated suicide and told her so.  We had been together since 2009 and I had gradually gotten worse with being lazy around the house, not helping when needed, not being affectionate enough... becoming more hostile, more emotionally abusive.  All around complete piece of shit.  Lots of things over my life compounded and broke me down to nothing and I took it out on her... and it wasn't her fault.  I told her she didn't love me, even though she would reassure me she did.  I told her I thought she was cheating, even though she never gave me a reason to think so.

I moved in with my Mom and Stepdad after that.  I struggled with some addiction at that point.  Got a good paying job (delivery driver) only to get fired because of failing the drug test.  She had been on my phone plan but right before they finally got cut off for good, she gave that phone number to her cousin.  She didn't want to talk to me, I understand now.  After they got cut off, I got a new number as well.  But I'd try to message her every now and then through FB, not to bother her, but just asking her to not completely give up on me.  I know now I was wrong to do that, but it happened and I can't change the past.

After meeting with several counselors and having some very helpful friends along the way, I feel like I'm not *him* anymore.  I'm clean, aside from coffee and cigarettes, lol.  I feel like I look at the world differently now.

But I have another problem.  She hasn't spoken to me since I moved out.  I don't know her number.  Someone else stays at that house from what a mutual friend told me.  I believe she might have blocked me on social media.  The last time I tried to message her was back in April.

I don't know what to do now, yall.  If its over then... its over.  According to our state laws (SC) one can only file for divorce after a separation period over 1 year, which has already passed.  I don't know what she wants to do.  She has no way of contacting me, and the only way I can contact her would be through a 3rd party (her family) or to show up at her job.  I really DO NOT want to do either of those.  Those are terrible ideas.

I want her to be happy.  I truly do.  Whether that's with me or without me.  But I want to be happy too.  If she wants to move on, that's life, I suppose.  But if so... I want to move on as well.  I don't want to just be stuck in this limbo anymore.

,Divorce,"I am codependent. That presented as control and abuse in many cases with my wife of 9 years (15 years together). She was codependent, that presented in doing everything for me because that is what you do for people you love.

I grew up as a typical millennial. Gold star for participating, I was smart, kind and funny by default. I didn’t have to do anything these traits were inherent. I was a good boyfriend because I thought I was. I cared for her and that was enough. 

Nevermind I would make comments about her looks, I was short with her, I was lazy and never visited her when she lived a town at school when we were dating. I wasn’t supportive and ever asked how she was feeling. I made all my anger and frustration her problem. Whenever she was mad at me she had to comfort me for her being mad at me. The whole gambit. 

She started standing up for herself. Verbally yelling at me. Even at stuff where I didn’t do anything wrong. She hit her limit and everything I did was wrong. It got bad. She laughed at me and made me feel small, I threw a plastic cup at the wall in response. Earlier in our relationship I kicked in an interior door because I wanted to keep talking during a fight. 

Im in therapy now and coming to terms with all my screw ups. I told her i would take the kids to an appointment and then had something come up at work and told her I couldn’t so she had to leave a meeting she called. I could keep going on and on about my constant screw ups. I know dwelling on the past doesn’t do anything to help, but I messed up, a lot. 

That doesn’t give her a right to yell at me. She thought the appropriate procedure was to get me to change rather than leaving herself. So that was her demand or else have me leave and walk away from everything. 

We’ve been separated since January. Still was angry with me, everything I did was wrong. I was using the separation to control her. Repeatedly asked when I was going to move back in. (Codependency issue). I tried moving back in for a week but that was terrible and traumatic on the kids. After that I got my own place and we set up a schedule when I couldn’t see the kids on my own. Since that time we’ve had other dust ups and me getting caught up on things and threatening divorce because of what I’m entitled to. “I’m their dad”, “I paid for that”, but the reality is I didn’t step up as much as I should have. I did a good amount of diapers but I also fought her on helping. I was lazy. I got my masters degree while she worked and took care of the kids in the evening. I didn’t even show gratitude. 

I see my kids twice a week based on the schedule she developed. Overnights on Tuesday nights and then again on alternating Fridays or Saturday’s. It works well. It was generous and more than I likely deserve. I’m trying to take advantage of it and learn how to be patient and kind and a good dad. I’m trying to work on mindfulness and discipline. I’m trying to embrace gratitude and have come to appreciate  even the little things she does. 

She hasn’t filed papers but is really starting to detach. It’s breaking me. I still love her so much but acknowledge my behavior didn’t show any of that. She’s just supposed to know how much I care. 

I’m losing my will to fight for my kids. I already have a generous schedule for seeing them. We’ve split finances and are splitting expenses 50/50 even though I make 30% more. The only thing is I’m covering my apartment rent and half of the mortgage of the house to help her. It’s still cheaper than the child support I would be paying. 

I am so remorseful and humbled. I am losing my will to stand up for myself as I’ve been wrong on things so many times and regret the stands I do take after we talk about it and I realize I again was selfish or had a bad take or misinformation. 

I’m doing my best to hide it from my kids when I see them and am trying like hell to be kind to my wife and start to repair the damage. She’s now seeing the benefits of being a single mom and I’m dreading once she finally decides to pull the trigger. 

I wish she had stood up for herself sooner, I wish she had told me how often she cried her self to sleep. I wish I hadn’t been so selfish and such an self centered a-hole.

,Divorce,"I'm currently coming up on year 9 of my marriage in November. Been with my wife for 11 years total. We have 3 wonderful kids, 3 cats, and a shit head Shiba Inu who we love.

My wife and I have struggled for many years. She cheated on me fairly early on in our marriage but I forgave her and we tried to move on. I wish it was that simple. Every few years we would go through some issue, be it she is talking to the guy she cheated on me with or she doesn't want to be married anymore or something else. Each time we would work though the issues and try to move forward. 

This cycle continued for the last 9 years. Earlier this year we went on family vacation, planned a trip to Japan, and were doing well I thought.  In July after I returned from a seminar, my wife told me she wanted to move back to her home town. She's always missed the place and would remind me every year how she wanted to move back. It was never in the chips as a) we are fr the same place and I hate it and b) my job keeps me where I am. One thing I didn't mention is I am the only one working. She is a homemaker and cares for our 3 kiddos.

Anyway, so we got into a fight about it and she told me she didn't know if she wanted to be married anymore. This struck me right in the heart. She said she needed time to think on it but wanted to keep going together while she thought. So we kept on together and I did everything I could to try to care for her and the kids. She is working on a job and needs to study for a test for it so I've taken up all the house work, laundry, cooking, cleaning, childcare, etc on top of my normal job. I'm not saying she should have to do everything but she literally did nothing other than study and watch Netflix. I kept quiet to be helpful but I was slowly crumbling under the weight and stress.

Then in late September, her grandmother passed away. We were on a trip to try to reconnect but cut it short as her gma was not doing well. She passed away as we made it into town. I was with her for the funeral, comforted her as she cried, supported her as best I could. I cried too. I loved her grandma very much. She was always so kind to me.

So we bury her and go back to try to have a normal day. She's distant and always on her phone. I assume she's just processing.  But I started to get a funny feeling about this. Something is off. So I confront her on Tuesday. Lay out my concerns and she tells me we need to talk. 

She tells me that she's been looking outside our marriage and had made up her mind awhile ago but was too afraid to tell me. She feared I would throw her out and be angry. I sat calmly and we talked. She admitted she had been talking to the guy she cheated with again as well. Swears they are just friends now and he's been helping her work through her emotions. I realize now she's maintained an emotional affair for this entire time and that is eating at me. She wants to go out and visit with him again and admits they would probably sleep together again while there. 

When all was said and done, I said she could stay at the house until she can get a job and get a place. We talked about assets and how we will divide things. I will maintain custody of the kids as we don't want to remove the from their school. We think we know the way forward but it's killing me. 

I'm struggling to not blame myself. I'm struggling to not feel useless and like a failure. She even admits this is all on her and it's not my fault. We are going to start paperwork next week. I don't want to take her to task at court. I still care about her alot and love her greatly. This feels one sided. I don't want to get divorced but I know this is best for everyone, including the kids and us but it's still hard.

I don't know why I'm posting here but just need to dump my feelings. I scheduled an appointment with a counselor to talk as well but I'm not sure how that will go. I'm just devastated and feels like my world is crumbling. I'm trying to hold it together for my kids the most. They don't know yet. I have to do my best for them.

Been with my wife for 11 years total. We have 3 wonderful kids, 3 cats, and a shit head Shiba Inu who we love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have struggled for many years. She cheated on me fairly early on in our marriage but I forgave her and we tried to move on. I wish it was that simple. Every few years we would go through some issue, be it she is talking to the guy she cheated on me with or she doesn&amp;#39;t want to be married anymore or something else. Each time we would work though the issues and try to move forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cycle continued for the last 9 years. Earlier this year we went on family vacation, planned a trip to Japan, and were doing well I thought.  In July after I returned from a seminar, my wife told me she wanted to move back to her home town. She&amp;#39;s always missed the place and would remind me every year how she wanted to move back. It was never in the chips as a) we are fr the same place and I hate it and b) my job keeps me where I am. One thing I didn&amp;#39;t mention is I am the only one working. She is a homemaker and cares for our 3 kiddos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so we got into a fight about it and she told me she didn&amp;#39;t know if she wanted to be married anymore. This struck me right in the heart. She said she needed time to think on it but wanted to keep going together while she thought. So we kept on together and I did everything I could to try to care for her and the kids. She is working on a job and needs to study for a test for it so I&amp;#39;ve taken up all the house work, laundry, cooking, cleaning, childcare, etc on top of my normal job. I&amp;#39;m not saying she should have to do everything but she literally did nothing other than study and watch Netflix. I kept quiet to be helpful but I was slowly crumbling under the weight and stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in late September, her grandmother passed away. We were on a trip to try to reconnect but cut it short as her gma was not doing well. She passed away as we made it into town. I was with her for the funeral, comforted her as she cried, supported her as best I could. I cried too. I loved her grandma very much. She was always so kind to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we bury her and go back to try to have a normal day. She&amp;#39;s distant and always on her phone. I assume she&amp;#39;s just processing.  But I started to get a funny feeling about this. Something is off. So I confront her on Tuesday. Lay out my concerns and she tells me we need to talk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She tells me that she&amp;#39;s been looking outside our marriage and had made up her mind awhile ago but was too afraid to tell me. She feared I would throw her out and be angry. I sat calmly and we talked. She admitted she had been talking to the guy she cheated with again as well. Swears they are just friends now and he&amp;#39;s been helping her work through her emotions. I realize now she&amp;#39;s maintained an emotional affair for this entire time and that is eating at me. She wants to go out and visit with him again and admits they would probably sleep together again while there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all was said and done, I said she could stay at the house until she can get a job and get a place. We talked about assets and how we will divide things. I will maintain custody of the kids as we don&amp;#39;t want to remove the from their school. We think we know the way forward but it&amp;#39;s killing me. &lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"I don't normally post my life issues, but I don't know what else to do and I'm utterly alone in this.

My wife and I have been together 12 years this week, married for 9.  She's always had a ton of mental health problems, made worse by a family that preaches acceptance rather than change, at least among blood relatives.  Prior to us meeting, she lost a grandmother she barely knew and it made her so suicidal that she was immediately medicated and went to therapy for a long time.  She has a long history of emotional instability bordering on a disorder like EID.  When her first boyfriend rejected her and went back to his ex, her reaction was to strip all bedroom items and throw them away.  Then she crawled into a bottle of vodka for weeks, and had sex with any male she could entice in her drunkenness.

The first time she and I ever had sex, she was the aggressive initiator and afterwards when I got up to use the toilet, she became hysterical and thought I was going to leave.

Our dating was pretty much what you might expect at this point... very intense, very affectionate.  Then my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.

She'd already been talking about marriage since months into our dating, and we'd been together around 2 years at that point.  Immediately, I start getting pressure about setting a wedding date.  I was emotionally distracted in being there for my family during my dad's cancer fight, which then turned into a rapidly progressing case of Alzheimer's Disease, and I told her we should wait a little longer... that it probably wasn't the best time.  

She fired back with argument after argument about why we should go ahead and do it, even using my Dad's cancer as leverage to convince me that we should get married before he gets worse, and that he'd probably love to see his youngest son get married.

When that didn't seem to convince me, she brought out the wrecking ball:  We do this, or we break up.  

Nevermind that my dad was dying... she needed that wedding.  ""Any reasonable woman would be demanding an engagement at this point.""  Against what was a nagging feeling I should just let her walk away... after much fighting I relented and agreed to a wedding date.

Fast forward four months into our marriage... I discover she's into self-harm.  She's a cutter.  I think I handled it pretty well considering I also had bacterial pneumonia when I found out, was coughing up blood, and was running a 102 F fever only to find out that she was so stressed by my illness that she was cutting herself.  How did I find out?  She's also AD/HD, and left her blood-stained pocket knife on the sink in the bathroom.

My dad died, 10 months later.  I didn't take it well.  I was already on anti-depressants that were keeping me veering mentally between irrational rage and ignorant bliss.  By the time I realized it was the medications causing me explode over minor frustrations it was apparently too late for my dear wife, who'd taken everything (not directed at her) personally.  She had also been unemployed for over six months at this point due to failing at one job as a teacher, then a job at another school, and then at the third school in a few years where she had to be escorted out because she had a breakdown and was sobbing hysterically to the point she called her Mom to pick her up and bring her back to our house.

Despite the problems, and between her bipolar shifts of telling me that ""our marriage has always been horrible"" and ""You're not the source of all my problems and I'm sorry if I blamed you""... we had a good marriage.   Despite her at times crazy behavior and my medicated madness... we got along, and I loved her.  But her seeming lack of empathy for me just kept getting worse.  I'd have gentle conversations with her about what my needs were, and I guess due to her AD/HD or whatever condition, she would either forget which prompted repeated conversations about more than just ""needs"", or she was disregarding it altogether.  I tried for so long to get her to either seek treatment or at least get counseling on her disorder.  I'm sorry, but when it's so bad that you forget to pay bills... when it's so bad that you don't notice you're mixing bleach and ammonia cleaners and sticking your face into a cloud of toxic chlorine gas.... it's time to get help.  She didn't.  Her family, mostly her mother, encouraged me to accept this ""wistful, flighty personality"" and that I was the problem.

My life kept adding more stressors:  job, neighbors from Hell, family drama, friends who died and friends who were critically injured, and the fact I was overwhelmed and burned out... my wife and her mother then tried to convince me that despite all the years of evidence to the contrary... their sudden explanation for my withdrawal and irritability was because I had ASD... they were convinced I had Asperger's Syndrome and proceeded to try and convince me of it.  I've been to two specialists to check... and I'm not on the spectrum.

A few months later, my mom was stricken with septic shock and she died within 24 hours due to a dental abscess, three months before Christmas.  I later found out that being sad at Christmas was unacceptable to my wife, who said that she ""couldn't even enjoy Christmas"" because of me.  I had requested nobody buy presents for me that holiday because, in my depression, I didn't want to give people the idea that I hated their gifts or wasn't appreciative.  But my unwillingness to ""fake it"" just wasn't deemed acceptable.

Four months later, she leaves after we've had an argument over the fact that we'd discussed having kids five years into our marriage, and she kept pushing it off and making us wait.  We'd been married 8 years at that point.  I'm now 39, she's 36.

I'm leaving a lot of details out, but full disclosure:  The anti-depressants turned me into an irritable asshole, her unmanaged AD/HD was taking a heavy toll on the relationship, but I wasn't abusive.  I didn't strike her, call her names, insult her... nothing.  I was just a crabby asshole and she took that personally even if I was just loud and venting about a bad day at the office.

She decided she needed a separation.  You know, because she was the one who was trying to convince me I was autistic.  Because I ruined her Christmas.  Because she didn't know if she wanted to have kids.  The reasons kept changing, and the goalpost has kept moving ever since.

If your wife leaves and says she may not come home, and may not come home even after counseling.... does that not sound like she's saying she wants a divorce?  Am I unreasonable thinking that?   She claims she had no clue that she'd communicated that.  

You know, despite the fact she's said it in anger at me in the past, and that she ""meant it.""  Her former employers also mentioned her ""extremely poor communication"".

So I offered that if she's that unhappy and doesn't know if she wants to come home, then we should just go ahead and get the divorce.  Welp, that was my screw-up too because holy crap she went nuts.  After freaking out for weeks, she suddenly does a 180, claims she wants it, and counseling wouldn't change her mind.  So, I start paperwork with a lawyer.  Wife freaks out again, saying she was in an emotional whirlwind and didn't mean it.  Then comes back after a couple of weeks and says she absolutely wants it

Weeks later after more this back-and-forth, she discloses she'd had an online affair with a guy who started flirting with her in... get this:  a co-dependency support group on Facebook.  Why?  Because we agreed to a divorce so she ""felt divorced"" and wanted comfort and sympathy.

Since then, my wife has presented several ""accept this, or walk away"" type proposals for us to ""reconcile"".  We've been separated for six months now.  All of the suggestions I made in the months prior were utterly rejected.  Now she's re-packaging those ideas, says ""turns out I need this along with all this therapy I'm getting now"" and wants ANOTHER six months of separation, this time with absolutely no communication between us.

Then she wants us to get marital counseling with a specialist... in Asperger's Syndrome couples.

How can someone claim to love a person when they're so self-centered that their wants or needs turn into ""my way or the highway""?  Am I stupid for even wanting to find a way to sort this out?  I don't know anymore.

I'm completely alone right now.  I have no close living family left.  Friends all have families of their own, wives and children, and little time for social lives outside their circles.  I go to work, I come home, spend time with my dog, play a video game or read, go to bed, wake up, and repeat.  Nobody checks up on me.  Nobody seems concerned for me.  The one person who vowed to be my friend, and be there for me, abandoned me.  I've been there to comfort her through all of her failed career attempts.  I've rushed to every car accident she's had to support her and take care of her.  I've helped her find work when she had no direction or motivation.  I've been supportive in all her endeavors to find happiness either through her hobbies, her work, travel to visit her friends, or spending time with her family.  I've nursed her back to health, even as recently as when she had kidney stones last year.  I've hugged her and loved her and tried to put her world back together whenever she let it fall apart around her.

Now I spent half my time wishing I'd done \*more\*, and the other half wondering why I even still try.

Here I am... nearly 40.  No friends, no family, no kids, and probably soon - no marriage.  It's hard to not feel like I was cheated out of a lot.  I know I can still re-marry and have kids, but the odds are building against me now.  I feel lied to, like many other lies I've found out about her, and now she wants me to wait on her to apparently decide if I'm worth it.

Now I don't even know if I am worth it.

She&amp;#39;s always had a ton of mental health problems, made worse by a family that preaches acceptance rather than change, at least among blood relatives.  Prior to us meeting, she lost a grandmother she barely knew and it made her so suicidal that she was immediately medicated and went to therapy for a long time.  She has a long history of emotional instability bordering on a disorder like EID.  When her first boyfriend rejected her and went back to his ex, her reaction was to strip all bedroom items and throw them away.  Then she crawled into a bottle of vodka for weeks, and had sex with any male she could entice in her drunkenness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time she and I ever had sex, she was the aggressive initiator and afterwards when I got up to use the toilet, she became hysterical and thought I was going to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our dating was pretty much what you might expect at this point... very intense, very affectionate.  Then my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;d already been talking about marriage since months into our dating, and we&amp;#39;d been together around 2 years at that point.  Immediately, I start getting pressure about setting a wedding date.  I was emotionally distracted in being there for my family during my dad&amp;#39;s cancer fight, which then turned into a rapidly progressing case of Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Disease, and I told her we should wait a little longer... that it probably wasn&amp;#39;t the best time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She fired back with argument after argument about why we should go ahead and do it, even using my Dad&amp;#39;s cancer as leverage to convince me that we should get married before he gets worse, and that he&amp;#39;d probably love to see his youngest son get married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When that didn&amp;#39;t seem to convince me, she brought out the wrecking ball:  We do this, or we break up.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevermind that my dad was dying... she needed that wedding.  &amp;quot;Any reasonable woman would be demanding an engagement at this point.&amp;quot;  Against what was a nagging feeling I should just let her walk away... after much fighting I relented and agreed to a wedding date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward four months into our marriage... I discover she&amp;#39;s into self-harm.  She&amp;#39;s a cutter.  I think I handled it pretty well considering I also had bacterial pneumonia when I found out, was coughing up blood, and was running a 102 F fever only to find out that she was so stressed by my illness that she was cutting herself.  How did I find out?  She&amp;#39;s also AD/HD, and left her blood-stained pocket knife on the sink in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad died, 10 months later.  I didn&amp;#39;t take it well.  I was already on anti-depressants that were keeping me veering mentally between irrational rage and ignorant bliss.  By the time I realized it was the medications causing me explode over minor frustrations it was apparently too late for my dear wife, who&amp;#39;d taken everything (not directed at her) personally.  She had also been unemployed for over six months at this point due to failing at one job as a teacher, then a job at another school, and then at the third school in a few years where she had to be escorted out because she had a breakdown and was sobbing hysterically to the point she called her Mom to pick her up and bring her back to our house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the problems, and between her bipolar shifts of telling me that &amp;quot;our marriage has always been horrible&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not the source of all my problems and I&amp;#39;m sorry if I blamed you&amp;quot;... we had a good marriage.   Despite her at times crazy behavior and my medicated madness... we got along, and I loved her.  But her seeming lack of empathy for me just kept getting worse.  I&amp;#39;d have gentle conversations with her about what my needs were, and I guess due to her AD/HD or whatever condition, she would either forget which prompted repeated conversations about more than just &amp;quot;needs&amp;quot;, or she was disregarding it altogether.  I tried for so long to get her to either seek treatment or at least get counseling on her disorder.  I&amp;#39;m sorry, but when it&amp;#39;s so bad that you forget to pay bills... when it&amp;#39;s so bad that you don&amp;#39;t notice you&amp;#39;re mixing bleach and ammonia cleaners and sticking your face into a cloud of toxic chlorine gas.... it&amp;#39;s time to get help.  She didn&amp;#39;t.  Her family, mostly her mother, encouraged me to accept this &amp;quot;wistful, flighty personality&amp;quot; and that I was the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life kept adding more stressors:  job, neighbors from Hell, family drama, friends who died and friends who were critically injured, and the fact I was overwhelmed and burned out... my wife and her mother then tried to convince me that despite all the years of evidence to the contrary... their sudden explanation for my withdrawal and irritability was because I had ASD... they were convinced I had Asperger&amp;#39;s Syndrome and proceeded to try and convince me of it.  I&amp;#39;ve been to two specialists to check... and I&amp;#39;m not on the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later, my mom was stricken with septic shock and she died within 24 hours due to a dental abscess, three months before Christmas.  I later found out that being sad at Christmas was unacceptable to my wife, who said that she &amp;quot;couldn&amp;#39;t even enjoy Christmas&amp;quot; because of me.  I had requested nobody buy presents for me that holiday because, in my depression, I didn&amp;#39;t want to give people the idea that I hated their gifts or wasn&amp;#39;t appreciative.  But my unwillingness to &amp;quot;fake it&amp;quot; just wasn&amp;#39;t deemed acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four months later, she leaves after we&amp;#39;ve had an argument over the fact that we&amp;#39;d discussed having kids five years into our marriage, and she kept pushing it off and making us wait.  We&amp;#39;d been married 8 years at that point.  I&amp;#39;m now 39, she&amp;#39;s 36.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m leaving a lot of details out, but full disclosure:  The anti-depressants turned me into an irritable asshole, her unmanaged AD/HD was taking a heavy toll on the relationship, but I wasn&amp;#39;t abusive.  I didn&amp;#39;t strike her, call her names, insult her... nothing.  I was just a crabby asshole and she took that personally even if I was just loud and venting about a bad day at the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She decided she needed a separation.  You know, because she was the one who was trying to convince me I was autistic.  Because I ruined her Christmas.  Because she didn&amp;#39;t know if she wanted to have kids.  The reasons kept changing, and the goalpost has kept moving ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your wife leaves and says she may not come home, and may not come home even after counseling.... does that not sound like she&amp;#39;s saying she wants a divorce?  Am I unreasonable thinking that?   She claims she had no clue that she&amp;#39;d communicated that.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, despite the fact she&amp;#39;s said it in anger at me in the past, and that she &amp;quot;meant it.&amp;quot;  Her former employers also mentioned her &amp;quot;extremely poor communication&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I offered that if she&amp;#39;s that unhappy and doesn&amp;#39;t know if she wants to come home, then we should just go ahead and get the divorce.  Welp, that was my screw-up too because holy crap she went nuts.  After freaking out for weeks, she suddenly does a 180, claims she wants it, and counseling wouldn&amp;#39;t change her mind.  So, I start paperwork with a lawyer.  Wife freaks out again, saying she was in an emotional whirlwind and didn&amp;#39;t mean it.  Then comes back after a couple of weeks and says she absolutely wants it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeks later after more this back-and-forth, she discloses she&amp;#39;d had an online affair with a guy who started flirting with her in... get this:  a co-dependency support group on Facebook.  Why?  Because we agreed to a divorce so she &amp;quot;felt divorced&amp;quot; and wanted comfort and sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, my wife has presented several &amp;quot;accept this, or walk away&amp;quot; type proposals for us to &amp;quot;reconcile&amp;quot;.  We&amp;#39;ve been separated for six months now.  All of the suggestions I made in the months prior were utterly rejected.  Now she&amp;#39;s re-packaging those ideas, says &amp;quot;turns out I need this along with all this therapy I&amp;#39;m getting now&amp;quot; and wants ANOTHER six months of separation, this time with absolutely no communication between us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then she wants us to get marital counseling with a specialist... in Asperger&amp;#39;s Syndrome couples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can someone claim to love a person when they&amp;#39;re so self-centered that their wants or needs turn into &amp;quot;my way or the highway&amp;quot;?  Am I stupid for even wanting to find a way to sort this out?  I don&amp;#39;t know anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m completely alone right now.  I have no close living family left.  Friends all have families of their own, wives and children, and little time for social lives outside their circles.  I go to work, I come home, spend time with my dog, play a video game or read, go to bed, wake up, and repeat.  Nobody checks up on me.  Nobody seems concerned for me.  The one person who vowed to be my friend, and be there for me, abandoned me.  I&amp;#39;ve been there to comfort her through all of her failed career attempts.  I&amp;#39;ve rushed to every car accident she&amp;#39;s had to support her and take care of her.  I&amp;#39;ve helped her find work when she had no direction or motivation.  I&amp;#39;ve been supportive in all her endeavors to find happiness either through her hobbies, her work, travel to visit her friends, or spending time with her family.  I&amp;#39;ve nursed her back to health, even as recently as when she had kidney stones last year.  I&amp;#39;ve hugged her and loved her and tried to put her world back together whenever she let it fall apart around her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I spent half my time wishing I&amp;#39;d done *more*, and the other half wondering why I even still try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am... nearly 40.  No friends, no family, no kids, and probably soon - no marriage.  It&amp;#39;s hard to not feel like I was cheated out of a lot.  I know I can still re-marry and have kids, but the odds are building against me now.  I feel lied to, like many other lies I&amp;#39;ve found out about her, and now she wants me to wait on her to apparently decide if I&amp;#39;m worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I don&amp;#39;t even know if I am worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long ramble, but if you read it... thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"  

Single income, no kids, no mortgage. Both have $60K+ student loan debt. I (M45) have a stable job, STBX (F45) is unemployed (self employed) by our choice for 10 years. STBX is in the process of launching a private coaching/consulting practice with excellent income potential.

We don’t fight. We have great nurturing harmony at home when we’re doing nothing. Dead bedroom going on 4 years. Used to be okay because we were still intimate and physically close. That has since drifted in the past few years. Her interests and mine don’t align in most cases – more passive, dismissive than strongly opposed. We’re both bored and I see us being more of a blocker to each other’s success. My ideas about how she should grow her business are out of alignment with how she sees things. 

My issue each time I tried to leave was that I don’t feel comfortable expressing myself and getting involved in activities (mundane – nothing taboo) that take me away from the “us” time. I’m socially outgoing and want to explore the unknown, learn about people, contribute to a community and at the same time have my “alone time” to create and write. I have lost the physical attraction. We disagree on most basic matters – she generally has the last word. I’m non-confrontational, give-in and accommodate her preferences. I’m passive aggressive and have worked on it – but my feelings and desire to be on my own has taken over. 

Friends don’t understand why I indulge her. Those that knew me before we got together see the different personality. They see the difference when we go out together vs when I am without her. 

She loves me so deeply. Would die for me. Wants to be there until I die. She’s nurturing in so many ways. She’s strong willed on all that she wants, but struggles to take ownership of the action needed to convert. I’ve bent to her will on where we live (and the rent we pay), pets (I prefer none, we have more than one) and generally how we spend our time.

I got intimately involved with another woman. It was exciting. I bonded with her on matters that are important to me but seemingly inconsequential. We had great physical chemistry. I ended it because it was unfair to her and to my STBX. I have not admitted the affair but feel it will be the key to her understanding I’m done. 

STBX is generally compassionate and drama free – and I want to work through this as fairly as possible – with the goal of us both being happy and successful, and someday…friends. She will likely not want to be friends. But we need to collaborate.

Some friends recommend getting a new bank account, line all the things up to pull the plug and not stay in the house once I confront the situation. I think she’ll feel abandoned. I don’t want to immediately abandon her and want to help with the transition.  

Planning to go through mediation since the split should be pretty simple – but haven’t filed divorce papers and expect we’ll keep a connection of some sort for a while to keep her with health insurance. 

Assuming we liquidate all material goods or agree on what each gets (I don’t want much and she doesn’t want what I want) – How much should I plan to give up from my income? 50% until I die? What about if/when she begins to make $ and eclipses my income (totally possible)? 

Other than my income, I have some stock and 401k from the employer. Assuming we can agree that half the shares go to her whenever she wants to sell…

What should I do to prepare and make it official – and “rip the band aid off” with the best for all in mind?

,Divorce,"This is hard, I've been lurking for a while, I feel it's time to post. I've seen some similar stories just kind of trying to tie it all in together. Wondering what everyone else has been through and also wanting to put my story out there. 

We've been together 11 years, married 9, 2 kids. Things have been very amicable. 
We split with the hope of getting back together then only silence from her, almost immediately. After a few weeks I finally pushed her to talk. She said she didn't expect it to change this fast. She doesn't miss me. Happy for all my positive changes but it's too late. 

I thought she just needed more time. I waited. I recently hung out with a mutual friend. He layed it out clear. He echoed a lot of the things she said when we talked, like that's she's moved on, she loves me but is no longer in love, maybe never was. A couple days later I confronted her, she confirmed. 

I asked her to go for counseling and she agreed but said it's basically useless at this point. For me I guess if nothing else it can help provide closure. 

In some ways I wish one of us royally screwed up so there is a reason for this. It sucks. I'm very much still in love with her. My heart still races when I see her, or get a text etc... Her smile gets me every time. She's emotionless when we talk, very removed. Not sure if its defense mechanism or she just doesn't care anymore.

Overall she's a great mother, too good in some ways, I feel I can't compete. She's fun, spontaneous, great with balancing schedules and getting the kids together with their friends, awesome at planning things. I have my strengths and I have certain bonds with the kids, but she's an all-star, in their eyes and mine. 

Honestly, I'd love to do joint activities and holidays together, just not sure she does. 

Another thing plaguing me lately has been the thoughts of her having sex. I know this probably sounds stupid, but I can't get it out of my head. She's open about sex. At least more open about discussions and maybe other things (not open marriage level). I'm a huge fan of sex, but more private about it. She's had more partners and probably experiences which I've had mixed feelings about. Jealousy at times, probably some attraction etc... When we had it together, it was great. Fast forward to now. I keep thinking about her beginning to explore again and man is it kicking my ass. Between the visualizations and the thoughts its just too much. 

I'm as sure as I can be that she's been faithful, even through the seperation, which helps keep things amicable.

I feel like I am living with a great friend who I co-parent with. There is no chemistry anymore and it is more than the stress of young children.

I am open to counseling but I don't know how to rediscover being sexually attracted to her.

The biggest thing holding me back is the kids. We are both very involved in parenting and child-related duties from bedtime to laundry to taking them to outings.

,Divorce,"Did anyone try to reconcile during separation?  If so how did you know it wasn't right?  My husband and I had been separated for 2 months then he decided he wanted to give it another chance.   Which I am all for because of kids and I love him.  During those 2 months I got therapy and did a lot  of soul searching.   He did not.   It's only been 2 weeks back together and while we mostly get along, every time I express any negative emotion(meaning not 100% happy and smiling)  he thinks it means we cannot get along.  He said he just wants us to be happy like it's reasonable to be happy 24/7.  I feel super insecure like if I say the wrong thing he will leave me again.   And I have never felt insecure like this in my life so I hope it fades.  But he is not open to talking about that and gets defensive.

,Divorce,"Hi, posting on behalf of my dad here.

So 1.5 years ago he got divorced (with the certificate and everything) but got NOTHING sorted out and decided in terms of property, finances, etc. They have a house in Canada that his ex-wife is trying to sell. I spoke to a lawyer yesterday who said that because they got divorced already, he no longer has spousal rights to that house but he \*is\* able to say he has interest in that house if he can prove he contributed to it.

The lawyer also said that payments also need to be made (due to differences in finances) as long as they are transparent and can provide said differences. My dad's ex wife essentially is trying to rob him of all the money he has and his share of the companies and housing and he's been conflict-avoidant and letting her because he believes she is just going through a ""phase."" (i KNOW, though he is starting to see the light now). Everytime he tries to talk to her she blocks him on social media and just continues to just do what she wants.

My dad is an idiot and his ex-wife is manipulative. The house is under her name only. They also have properties in China, companies in China that are solely under her name even though he was ""technically"" co-owner and contributed just as much. Basically he's not on record *anywhere* when it comes to ownership. He allowed her to handle all the finances with the properties and company and every month he just got a few thousand in pocket money (This is not information he told me until today).

I am worried because he let his ex-wife handle *all. the. financial. information.* He essentially almost has nothing to back him up on any of his financial statements besides his word. All he can prove right now is that he went from living in a 5000 sqft house to renting a shitty apartment in China while he's living paycheck to paycheck. (My dad is a Canadian citizen but he and his ex are ethnically Chinese. He's trying to stay in China to work this out with her).

I want to retain this lawyer but again, I did not know that my dad did *nothing* to leave a trail until he called me today. Although the lawyer seemed confident in our consultation, this was not an issue I brought up. So my question is: how much does this information change things? Is it a gamechanger? I would like to retain this lawyer but I don't want to have my dad sign the documents only for the lawyers to look at this information and realize that this case is unwinnable.

They are so rude. We all(my family and his includes) know my kids have seen hell and been through way too much. Time will heal them and being finally free from the constant abuse of their father is what is in the plate now but their dysfunction is costing us a positive person.... what parenting tips for angry kids do you have?

My ex and I have been real good. Civil. Doing things with our girls. Helping each other financially and if the other needed a “personal day”.

I found out last night that his team hadn’t signed up for the new season, making him available now to take our daughter to practice. I asked if we could go back to our original schedule. He was upset at the request because he thought he’d have every Friday available since I had originally offered. 

My take is, I offered to allow him to play. If he’s not playing, we should be okay In going back to the original schedule because he’s not playing anymore.

,Divorce,"Hi everybody. I posted here a few days ago about how anxious I was about seeing my STBXH on Wednesday night for the first time since he had left me back in June. Against many suggestions I went alone. I suggested we meet at a busy coffee shop that has outdoor seating. As soon as I pulled into the parking lot I could see him sitting at a table. I wanted to sit there for a minute to collect myself and my thoughts but he saw me too so I felt like I should get out of the car.  

When I first sat down it was silent. I have a look I tend to give when someone wrongs me. I know I had that look of disgust on my face. I finally said “so what do you want to talk about?” He said, “it seems like you’re wanting some type of closure.” I called him out, told him what a piece of shit he was. How he broke me, mentally, physically, emotionally. He told me how he felt bad. How he wanted to console me, how it made him feel terrible that he was responsible for what i had become. That  he had lost friendships because of his actions. I also told him that he was having some kind of midlife crisis and he was just feeding his narcissistic ego and he responded with words verbatim from his stupid homewrecker. “If that’s your psychologists narrative that you want to buy into than believe what you want”. He starting to speak like her and that killed me. But he still didn’t feel bad enough. He still lives with the stupid skank. He still thinks she’s better than me.  He still defends her. The consoling comment is one that really stuck. One of his shitty excuses when I woke up that morning to the AP text of “I can’t wait to be in your arms again” was that he just gave the best hugs. So let me get this straight....... it’s ok for you to give “hugs” to some 21 old whore who is not your wife, but not your wife who’s mental health has gone down the fucking toilet. Don’t want anyone thinking he’s cheating on her by giving his ex wife a hug in public. Fuck you. 

There were moments of silence, then me trying to get composure. He asked what I had been up to all summer. I wish I wouldn’t have told him anything about what I’ve been doing. I feel like he sat through those 2 hours just powering through  until I gave up the keys. Like he didn’t actually give a shit and was just pretending. That’s the only way I could think it, if he still wants to be with that home wrecking whore. I don’t know. I broke. I let him know how much he hurt me. I cried a lot. Finally after I gave him the keys and we were still sitting there I wanted to tell him how much I missed him and I knew that was the moment I had to go. I left sobbing uncontrollably. I do miss him so much. I had this hope that he would say that he made a mistake. And that would be the power transfer for me c where I could say,”sorry Charlie, you fucked up. “ but again it didn’t happen that way and he still has all the power. I’m just so sad. I probably shouldn’t have gone. I approved the divorce decree yesterday so this is really coming to an end. 

Im so ready to not cry. 108 days in a row that I’ve ugly cried. I try all of the things the people suggest. I run. I do yoga. I meditate. I go to therapy. I have a great support system of friends and family . I got a new job. I go to music shows. I do things when people invite me out. I created a dating app profile to which I’ve barely even utilized. (1 ton of guilt in that) NONE OF THIS WORKS. I don’t believe in taking prescription drugs for anything. I just feel so hurt and sad and betrayed that it consumes me. 

I know by seeing him the other night it brought back all of these feelings tenfold. I can’t even say that the scab was picked off the wound because I don’t feel like there hasn’t even been any healing done yet.  Sorry if this entry isn’t written too well.

,Divorce,"I spent a couple hours after lunch today feeling immense pain of loss. It has been awhile since I felt it but I knew it would come again. I know this will not be the last time either. As I allowed myself to feel, I felt the need to write in my journal. I would like to share with you what I wrote.

For a bit of background for those who have not read my original post, I am in a divorce I did not want and thought I was fulfilled. I am 2 months into divorce and have spent a ton of effort working on myself. Part of that process for me has been to allow myself to feel any and all feelings as they appear.

&amp;#x200B;

Today the pain of loss has flooded my mind. It is not from missing my STBX. It is not for longing for a 2nd chance. It is not from fear of living alone. This pain is for mourning the loss of fulfillment that I thought I had. I achieved something that I hoped for when I was a teenager. I had a life that I was sharing and building with someone I felt love for. The hopes and dreams of watching our children grow into adulthood, plan our retirement together, and help raise any grandkids together as one. All that is gone, at least in the short term. I’ve lost that feeling of achievement and contentment.

The longing for that fulfillment has appeared once more. I let the pain come and swallow me whole. I watch the pain sink down to the depths of my soul. I let the pain settle in completely so I could understand the source. It feels like something is gnawing away at me. The fact that I was ready to dedicate myself to helping my partner find the fulfillment that I know I felt, but I can no longer do so. I let the pain continue to feed. I must do this, buy why? It feels like a parasite eating away the dead and scarred parts of my old relationship preparing me for the next one.

As I realize this, I find myself feeling peace again. The pain recedes, evaporating away in the sunshine of hope. The warm light of hope feels comforting. I realize that my dream of helping my partner find fulfillment is still possible, only this time that dream has been splintered. I can still watch my children grow and help them find fulfillment. I can continue to understand myself and work on fulfilling my personal dreams. I will allow my STBX to go and hope that she can find her fulfillment.

,Divorce,"Hi all! 

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry to say that I have landed here. Me (33M) and my wife (35F) have been married for 3 years and have a 2 year old girl at home in a pretty large house and a dog. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, er have always been a bit rocky towards eachother. Fights that have escalated verbally and now the time has come that I believe we are too far from eachother. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's mainly about on how we are not allowed to be your true self together. I cannot be me around her and she cannot be she, if that makes any sense. We are very different and have always been, but right now I really doubt that I will be happy with her (or that she will be happy with me). 

&amp;#x200B;

But, I don't believe that she has the courage to end this marriage. Most of all I know for a fact that she doesn't believe that a divorce can be good to our kid (I actually don''t believe that either but I think we have the means to make that work). So most probably I will be the one to end it without her agreeing to this. This will ofcourse make me ""the bad one"" who ""destroys our family"" and ""ruins our daughters childhood"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I now that I will hear that, because that's one of the things she does, guilt trip people to gain control over them. 

And I have a LARGE problem with being the bad guy and hurting people. I hate it. I feel really bad and right now I am getting depressed just because the thought of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So please, help me. How will I handle the guilt that is coming my way? And it would be a huge plus if I could get some help with handling hurting others aswell (mainly because you can't go thorugh life without hurting anyone....).

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry to say that I have landed here. Me (33M) and my wife (35F) have been married for 3 years and have a 2 year old girl at home in a pretty large house and a dog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, er have always been a bit rocky towards eachother. Fights that have escalated verbally and now the time has come that I believe we are too far from eachother. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s mainly about on how we are not allowed to be your true self together. I cannot be me around her and she cannot be she, if that makes any sense. We are very different and have always been, but right now I really doubt that I will be happy with her (or that she will be happy with me). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I don&amp;#39;t believe that she has the courage to end this marriage. Most of all I know for a fact that she doesn&amp;#39;t believe that a divorce can be good to our kid (I actually don&amp;#39;&amp;#39;t believe that either but I think we have the means to make that work). So most probably I will be the one to end it without her agreeing to this. This will ofcourse make me &amp;quot;the bad one&amp;quot; who &amp;quot;destroys our family&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ruins our daughters childhood&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I now that I will hear that, because that&amp;#39;s one of the things she does, guilt trip people to gain control over them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have a LARGE problem with being the bad guy and hurting people. I hate it. I feel really bad and right now I am getting depressed just because the thought of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please, help me. How will I handle the guilt that is coming my way? And it would be a huge plus if I could get some help with handling hurting others aswell (mainly because you can&amp;#39;t go thorugh life without hurting anyone....). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"My wife and I are approaching our 3yr anniversary. We have a 2.5 yr old child. We rushed into marriage when we found out she was pregnant and we jointly decided to have the baby (best decision I ever made, btw).
We dated briefly in college, and reconnected almost 8 yrs later-both very lonely and longing for a relationship. We were married slightly more than a year after we began dating/cohabiting. 
The differences in our personalities and our worldview—shockingly—have not changed and obviously they were all reasons not to be married in the first place. However, as I’m sure many people have done before me, we ignored those problems and resolved to figure it out together while raising a child. However, we are now pondering selling our house and moving—which I don’t really want to do—to be in a better school district, and I fear that if I continue along I will find myself in an even worse situation(new place, possibly more children, etc) if I don’t say something now. 

I feel that in my gut, I don’t want to do this anymore. I also fear for the happiness of our child. I also fear that it isn’t fair to anyone to keep going along if I’m secretly unhappy. 

My wife and I just don’t see the world the same way—politics, religion, schooling, urban vs. suburban, you name it. To be blunt, we want different things. And honestly, we shouldn’t have gotten married, and I don’t think we would have if it hadn’t been for the baby. 

I’m looking for help, from anyone really. But especially if you are/were in a situation like mine: relatively new marriage with young children. Am I being selfish? Have I not given it enough time? Will my child hate one of us and love the other? Will my net worth be totally devastated by starting down this road? For the record, there is no infidelity or abuse or anything like that. 
I’m tempted to let inertia win and just keep going along, but I know deep down that I don’t want that. I just don’t really know what to do. 

The biggest thing that makes me want to stay is that my parents were also divorced, and I want more than anything to give my child a stable 2-parent home. I don’t want my child to feel different at school because they have their moms house and their dads house. I remember those feelings all too well. I just don’t know what to do.

,Divorce,"This week something happened with my ex that was a little scarier in terms of boundaries than anything she's done before.

My ex and I shared a sitter for nearly two years after we got divorced, but this sitter was not good. She'd give the kids candy and toys to get them to behave, she would be physical with my daughter and even left marks on her. The babysitter wasn't great, but the big problem for me was the connection to my ex. I wanted to fire the sitter several times, but that would mean more conflict with their mom. The babysitter became a way for my ex to keep an eye on my house, and control how I parented the children when they were with me. But the worst is that my ex treats the kids like crap, and the kids have terrible behavior around my ex. The sitter would repeat my ex's behavior toward the kids, in my house, and their tantrums carried over.

So this fall when my ex got a new job and didn't need a sitter much anymore, I decided to man up (so to speak :) and find a sitter of my own. This worked great. I liked her, the kids liked her. No tantrums, no conflicts. Then my ex decided one day that she had to drop off the kid's shared bag (stuffed animals, meds, etc) at my house, and she had to do it before I got home. Which also happened to be when the babysitter was here. That kinda freaked me out and made me nervous. Then this week I found out that my ex had gotten my sitter's number and asked her to watch the kids at her house some days. WTF. My attempt to keep her out of my life was smashed again.

I tried so hard for the past two years to separate myself from my ex, and to keep the kids out of the conflict. And my ex keeps finding ways of pulling me back. She will create crises with the kids that need my immediate attention. She will take these crises to anyone who will listen, and say that decisions need to be made, and that we need to talk about things. There were daily phone calls until earlier this year. All of those conversations she had to have for ""the sake of the children"" were a way for her to continue her emotional abuse toward me. I've tried so hard to get away from her, and she uses the kids to get back to me.

She's never physically abused me or the kids, or done anything to my property. Just constantly violating boundaries. Can I get a restraining order?

I still don't think that's the case though. We have had our ups and downs like every married couple but for the most part it's been a good marriage.

A couple of years ago he started a new career and was very happy about getting in to something he really enjoyed doing. Unfortunatley he ended up in a really bad company and he was bullied by his fellow co-workers. It was an awful time and I did what I could to support him but it wasn't enough.

Finally he got a new job and things started looking up, but he couldn't get rid of the anxiety attacks and his (what I know now is) his PTSD. He started projecting it on to other things and in the end it was only me left. Of course I had to be the problem. He ended up accusing me of cheating on him. After that he stopped talking to me. Instead he posted on various internet forums (ha the irony, here I am) and of course the wolf you feed and all that. Not at any point has he spoken to me about how horrible he feels and the things he wrote about me on those forums are really hurtful and really mean and  in mpst cases completly taken out of context and I don't feel I even know the man that wrote that. I found them by accident. 

My therapist and our therapist have both said this is down to his PTSD. His therapist has, as far as I know, not mentioned it. I feel it's such a shame our marriage has ended because of this. If I could go back in time and tell him not to take that job I would. But here we are, about to be divorced, living single life, and swapping kids every week.

I'm in the early stages of creating what I hope to be the ultimate online blog for tips, strategies, and resources for overcoming heartbreak after a divorce or breakup *(after experiencing my own journey of healing).*

,Divorce,"So to preface this, this isn’t going to be terribly organized or anything. I’m pretty young and I just need to get it off my chest, as I don’t feel I can tell other people about my situation.

My parents divorced about a year ago. My dad had lived with us off and on for quite a while, and my parents often had long periods of separation. As a kid (currently 15m), even I don’t really fully understand what was going on that made it fall apart. My parents didn’t fight much in front of me, but my mom cried a lot. It might have been more noticeable, but I was an oblivious little kid at the time, so my family situation was a bit of a blur. My parents would always try to hide the arguments, but us kids could always sense that something wasn’t right.

Sometime in November last year, my parents called us in for a family meeting. All of us were immediately on edge, as family meetings had never been about anything good. After a bit of beating around the bush, my dad finally gets there. They’re getting a divorce. I remember my heart sinking, but at this point I felt like it was going to happen sooner or later. That was a hard night, not only for the divorce, but just how hard it was to see my mom and sister cry about it. Ever since then, I don’t think I’ve been quite the same. It’s been a long time and while I’ve recovered to an extent on the outside, I think Ive jus compartmentalized my feelings and kept going. I’ve become much quieter and more reserved, and I feel like I can’t vent about any of this to anyone, which is part of why I’m even posting this.

,Divorce,"I always thought i had the picture perfect marriage. We are high school sweethearts who go on adventures and never fight. we never fight about money or stupid shit, and if there was a problem we always talked it out rationally. We have had a lot of fun and always talked about future things we wanted to do. We even just bought our first house this year. 

But for the last couple of months we haven't been seeing eye to eye with sex, and its slowly destroying our marriage. This time last year i worked two jobs and would be out of the house for 16 hours at a time so we had no sex at all. Earlier this year my husband talked to me and we agreed we had to change things. I quit my dream job and found a job that's on a career path. I only work 40 hours a week now so i have  been trying to improve things in the bedroom. We now have sex at least once a week and we have tried new games and other stuff to spice it up. But its not enough for him. He saids he thinks about sex 24/7 and is always horny and im not like that. He saids he is tired of not being on the same page sexually and for him sex is a major part of the relationship. We keep trying to talk it out and try new things but i feel with each conversation we have divorce becomes a more realistic solution. I love him so much and i don't want to lose him, but i don't know how to fix things. We are both tired and frustrated with trying to find a solution  but i don't want to give up and i think he does.

He saids he thinks about sex 24/7 and is always horny and im not like that. He saids he is tired of not being on the same page sexually and for him sex is a major part of the relationship. We keep trying to talk it out and try new things but i feel with each conversation we have divorce becomes a more realistic solution. I love him so much and i don&amp;#39;t want to lose him, but i don&amp;#39;t know how to fix things. We are both tired and frustrated with trying to find a solution  but i don&amp;#39;t want to give up and i think he does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we get a divorce he will be fine, i know he will. But i will be left with nothing. We are high school sweethearts and i have never been with anyone else. I followed him to a new state for his career and have no friends or family here that can help me. Money wise he has it all. Almost every dollar i make goes to paying off student loans. Without him I don&amp;#39;t even know how i will pay a phone bill. The house is in his name because of my loans so i have no legal claim. I don&amp;#39;t want  to lose him or our life together, but i feel like i am no control over anything anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Hello to all the abandoned and the abandoners. 

I’ll try to keep it short: found out that my wife is having an affair in September. I was heartbroken and devastated, but am managing to spiral through it. We both are in our 30’s and have full time jobs and two kids. 

The challenge here is that we still live in our house. The way our work schedules work makes it very difficult to separate: one has to drop kids off in the morning and the other has to pick them up in the evening. Additionally, i doubt that my wife would have enough income and credit score to be able to afford a separate place. She doesn’t want to rent as we both agree that it will reduce the quality of live for our kids. The idea we agreed upon is to sell the house and find separate places close by to take care of the kids together. 

I don’t know when and how soon this can be resolved. We already met with the people who are selling our house, but we agreed that we need a plan before we put it on the market. 

But while this is developing, we keep living together, and we even sleep in the same bed. I prepare lunches for my wife, kiss her on the cheek every morning when she leaves for work. She does laundry, cooks food, etc. I also know that she keeps seeing her affair partner every day, because they work together. 

Is this situation healthy for me? Should i take steps to move out asap? We both understand that separating will make thongs worse for us both and the kids financially and lifestyle wise.

,Divorce,"# Abandonment Comes in Many Forms

When I was a kid, my mom would always say to me, ""I give you an inch, you take a mile!"".  That was when she was angry at me for something.  When the issue wasn't so serious, she'd say, ""You always want what you can't get!"" or ""You always want more and more""

Looking back at the way I was perceived by her, my dad, my family- I realize my behavior hinted at something significant...  Was it just because I was a kid, a persistent go-getter?  No.  That desire to want more and more continued into adulthood.  It's led me to where I am now.  With less than ever.  Never satisfied- bored quickly- loss of contentment in a beautiful, perfect life.  Why?

In doing some major soul searching, and some hard reading- I've learned that people with 'Abandonment of Love' issues tend to desperately cling to something they feel they may lose.  When I was a teenager, and I had new boyfriends who started  to show signs of contentment, it was perceived as loss of interest, loss of love.   I would desperately cling on, or confront them with hostile feelings as to why, eventually pushing them away, making them run for the hills.  

I realize I did this because I thought their normal healthy behavior was not normal.  Because I wasn't normal.  My behavior indicated a deeper problem, rooted from my past.  When I was little, about 2 years old I think- my father left my mother and I.  Without telling her.  He asked my mom for a 20 dollar bill and head out for ""the night"".  My mom hadn't realized he was actually leaving her until she found out that he had been robbed, stabbed, and was in the hospital.  Now to be fair, there are two sides to every story.  This side comes from my mother, who always took pride in never poisoning me against my father...although I wonder if she knew that she unintentionally did.  I'll explain later.  

Anyway, he survived.  His family told my mother that he was leaving her, that he didn't want to see her.  The End.  Okay, so fast forward to the years I can remember;  My father would call me on holidays and my birthday, and he would promise to take me on vacations in the summer.  Over the course of 10 years in my childhood that I can remember, He would tell me of the great summer plans he had for us.  Every year.  Out of those 10 years, I saw him 3 times.  To his defense, he did live literally across the country.  He also had problems that prevented him from making those plans reality- either legal, financial, or otherwise.  

Every time he had to cancel, my mother would hand me the phone, tears in her eyes...That would prep me for disappointment.  It also showed me that they were not a united front.  No solidarity.  Her loyalty was to me.  She wouldn't try to hide her anger at him for letting me down.  But the thing is, I was a bubbly sweet kid.  I wasn't heartbroken over broken plans.  I would be home for the summer, playing with my brothers and my friends.  I not once was upset.  But seeing my mom upset?  Seeing her anger?  Now THAT effected me.  (Remember that co-parents to be)

I always told people (And told myself) that it was totally fine that my father wasn't very present in my life, because my mom had remarried a man who I quickly grew to call Daddy.  He treated me like his very own flesh and blood, and I love him the way a daughter loves her dad.  So I had a dad in my life- he gave me structure, discipline when needed, and most importantly, love.  So I didn't lack in that department.  But deep down the scar from being abandoned was still there.  Denying it, even as a child, caused the foundation of my issues.  

I can go on and tell you how a trusted individual hurt me, broke my faith in humanity, my trust in others.  I can tell you that later on in my life, I was abused once more by someone that I clung to, when I should have let go.  I could write books on these subject.  I won't.  Not today.  I'll just say that I blamed myself for putting my own self in those situations where these events occurred.  And when I told my mom...she didn't protect me like she should have.  That in itself, I consider ""abandonment"".   

I forgave.  I forgive.  It's what I do.  I told myself that I let it go.  But really, if I think about it, I just skipped over it.  Using distractions or crutches my whole life to ""get over it"".  That's what I do.  Me forgiving was my way of holding on to love in my life.  To be okay with the ones that hurt me.  To love them anyway.  I continue to want to hold the ones I love in my life...even if they hurt me.  Even if they didn't hurt me, but don't love me back.  I want what I can't have.  The never-ending cycle of wanting... and sadness over love lost. 

Like I said, there are many forms of abandonment.  I have a couple more life events to interpret on this subject...for another day.

Since the shock of this revelation, I have made great strides in my know personal growth, I have further addressed my depression, I have start to retrain for a new career, quit drinking and exercise regularly. I also agree that our marriage wasn't great and we have been in a negative rut.

Leaving the kids would be difficult for her as there mother. She left for 1 night and came home is bits. she say she is messed up and needs time, that was almost 3 weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of been on the edge for over 2 months, and she&amp;#39;s no closer to a decision...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like given up! Shouldn&amp;#39;t she know by now... I just feels unfair, I just to start moving forward!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone been in this situation before? I could do with some advice...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long should I wait...&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Hello all,

My wife (24F) and I (26M) were married in Salt Lake and moved to california for school and have decided to separate. After doing some research I found that Utah divorces seem much easier and quicker than California divorces. Online it says that to divorce in Utah you must live there 3 months prior to filing. I don’t really have a way to do that because of school but my mother lives in Salt Lake. Considering that so many people get married in Utah and then move to other states later, I figured that I can’t be the only one to ever try filing in Utah from another state.

,Divorce,"# Get up.  Or Stay down.  Either way- Listen up...

I had an amazing weekend away, visiting a relative who happens to also be my best friend these days.  We laughed and we cried, as we bonded over the same life shattering experience.  The lonely road to Divorce.  I left for home feeling refreshed, positive, and excited about the new changes coming my way.  I thought I had hit a major milestone, thought I had turned a page.  Ha.  

With advice from a reader, I had picked up the book ""The Journey From Abandonment to Healing"", by Susan Anderson.  If you don't have this book- get it-  seriously so helpful.  Anyway, I had actually only read a little as I was on my WAY to visit my cousin, but immediately I connected with some of what I was going through.  The author talks about the 'SWIRL' effect, which represent the 5 stages of grief in losing love.  She also connected the name ( 'SWIRL' ) of the process, for the fact that you go through each stage over and over again, until healing has taken place.   

So when I thought I had turned a corner in my process, little did I know that I would be repeating the First Phase, 'Shattering', sooner than later.  Shattered.  Completely broken and useless.  That's how I was yesterday afternoon and into night, until sleep mercifully ended it around 2am. 

I had picked up my kids from school.  I got them settled inside with a snack and their homework.  I had to finish cleaning my car you see, so I wasn't ready to be ""present"" with my children.  That was probably mistake number one.  I was probably outside for about 45 seconds before the first kid came out, telling on the other.  Then the next one came out, yelling in defense.  Then the third came out saying she couldn't concentrate on homework- ""DO SOMETHING MOM!""

So I set everyone straight, and began to hustle, knowing it wouldn't be long before the next wave of drama came out.  I'm cleaning my car, dragging a step stool to reach the top, getting completely soaked in water and chemicals.  I broke two of my nails, and I was freezing cold.  All the while kids kept coming out to ask for help with homework, or tell me what a jerk the other one was being.

It crashed on me.  This is my life.  Washing cars on step stools and parenting.  On my own.  Alone.  With no promise of love ever again.  Alone.

The kids kept fighting, and I lost my will to be present, to diffuse the situation.  Instead I mindlessly kept washing my stupid car.  My chest started to hurt, my throat tightened, it was difficult to breathe.  I couldn't breathe enough.  My wet hands were ice, my feet soaked, my body hurt.  Energy to even stand left me.  This was my life now.  No one to help me.  From now on, when I have my children, I will be a single mom.  No support, no back up.  No help.  I will have to work double for them, and put aside the things I need to do (Like wash my car).  

I sobbed to get air, I still couldn't breathe.  No tears came, just sobs.  Maybe because my body knew I couldn't let them see.  I had to pull my shit together and get inside, be present.  So I did just that, got them all ready for soccer practice, and off we went.  My daughters and I sat in the car as my son was at his practice.  It started again.  Panic.  I told my oldest I had to go home and asked if she minded staying with her siblings at practice for a bit.  Thank God for her.  She really was heaven sent.  

So I went home and I cried.  Tears came this time, and my body seemed to rock back and forth with every effort to get more air, to find relief in the pain that seemed to explode from my chest...from my heart.  I laid down on the couch and cried until I had to go back to pick up my kids.  I pulled myself together once more.  It's absolutely amazing what you can manage for your kids.  The night continued with a late dinner, showers, and hugs and kisses.  Then I said goodnight to my three reasons for living.  After they were all tucked in, I went to clean up the kitchen.

This time it came down like an avalanche.  I couldn't stand, I didn't even want to.  I cried on the floor for hours.  When you feel so low, so broken- it feels comforting to physically be that low.  To not give any effort in functioning.  When you're on the floor, you can let your body melt, and it feels good to give such surrender to your emotions.  There were several times when I started to text my ex...one saying that I needed him.  One saying that I regret everything.  One saying that I don't want to live.  One saying that I can't do this.  One saying that he needed to come get his kids in the morning because I didn't think I could manage getting out of bed in the morning.  I did NOT send ANY of those...thankfully.  

Not that I didn't feel those things, I did... I felt everything and nothing at the same time.  I wanted a glass of wine so bad, something to help, anything.  But I refrained.  My therapist said she wanted me to feel every emotion that came my way, without numbing it.  The ONLY way to go through it, and really heal from it, is to FEEL it in its enormity.  I eventually picked myself up off the floor and graduated to the couch.  After some time sharing my tears with the furniture, I managed to go upstairs to my room.  Exhaustion took over.  I thought for sure this morning would be the worst morning of my life.  

But here's the thing about the process that we go through-  you DO get through it.  I woke up this morning feeling okay.  I took care of my appearance.  I made my kids an awesome breakfast and got them to school on time.  I came home and finally cleaned my kitchen, and then hung up a picture, and more cleaning.  I feel okay.  I know that I'm not totally through it.  I know I will have nights like that again, but I want to tell you-  that annoying saying, ""This too, shall pass"" is right on point.  And ya know what?  It sucks- no one wants to hear that when they are laying on the floor feeling like they'd also like to get run over by a truck.

But I'm telling you to go through it.  Being 'present and mindful' doesn't just apply to your children, or happy times.  It also means 'be present' in the shit too.  Don't skip over it, it'll only come back to haunt you.  Be in the moment- revel in your tears, hug yourself tight as you sob.  Feel your throat close, feel your heart ache.  Cry on the floor if you need to, cry in your car, in your bed, wherever- but please let it out and CRY.  It hurts.  But experience it.  Because you can't get THROUGH something by hopping over it with distractions or ""crutches"". 

You can only get through the pain when you let yourself experience it in its entirety.  I'm saying you really need to appreciate the dark place you're at...so that you can also experience how good it feels to get to the other side of it, on your own.  The other side may still lead you down that horrible path of ""Shattering""- but if it does, it's because you  didn't heal completely- and you didn't get to the other side of it. 

So hey you, crying on the floor.  It's okay.  I'm right with ya.  Don't get up.  But get it out.  Get it all out and then some.  And I promise you- it gets better.",t2_3s0zcn04,False,,0,False,"Hey you, Crying on the floor- Read this right now.",[],r/Divorce,False,1,,0,False,t3_dfj4ee,False,light,,public,136,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Getting Started,False,136,,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1570665766.0,text,1,,text,self.Divorce,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Get up.

,Divorce,"Mostly I feel angry. I don’t even know if this belongs here. I’m an adult, recently married but my own parents are getting divorced after 27 years together.
They’ve had their problems, but they have always gotten through it and vowed to work through things together forever.
Well, my dad didn’t come home Saturday night. Sunday morning my mom and I thought he was dead. We were so afraid. She kept thinking he was cheating on her. I asked her for evidence (she can jump to conclusions), and she had a little bit not much. I wasn’t buying it.
My dad arrived at their house and called my mom. It was so weird. We came home and he acted like everything was so chill. He refused to give us details where he was, but he said he “needed space.” I thought maybe he just didn’t want to talk about it then, but he still has been tight lipped and says he owes us nothing. I thought my father was DEAD...I think he owes my mom, me, and my siblings something.
Anyhow, today he told my mom that he’s done and wants a divorce. He left my parents home for a long time to “go to his mom’s.” He never went there.
He’s cheating on my mom and is such a coward that he won’t admit it. I tried to give him an out on Sunday morning by saying I just wanted honesty, and he lied. 
He disgusts me. He lied. He cheated. He ruined my family. I don’t really care that all of us kids are adults. It still hurts, and I still don’t want to speak to him. Currently trying to support my mom as best I can.

,Divorce,"This is long, im sorry. Im asian (36) and my husband (39). We met in hongkong where i was working at the time 6 years ago
 After about three years of LDR and talking online, we decided to get a fiance visa. I moved to midwest with him where i literally dont know anybody. Its not that i should be scared, im educated and can speak english quite fluently. I have always been independent and consider myself a strong person. I have backpacked in Europe alone before so going to places alone I havent been before doenst scare me. I can take care of myself. Anyways, i didnt know he lives with his mom. I didnt think this is a redflag because in asia we live with our parents and he has a full time job. But it bothers me because the house is on hoarders status. They have three dogs that poop inside during winter and there are molds everywhere. I will have to write a book to be able to fully describe how filthy it is. His mom shops on every garage sale she can find. Because i love him, i said, fuck it, i will clean this house. And clean it i did! Well, to a point where its atleadt livable enough. Its still filthy and disgusting. My mother in law didnt say anything despite it being her house. She was somewhat happy but i can tell it bothers her that all of a sudden i took over her stuff. The only thing that got her through my cleaning is seeing some of her stuff organized and the rest in the garage because i dare not throw anything away. I know what hoarders are like but at the same time, im not gonna live in filth. My husband was sleeping on the couch before and thought this was normal. He and his mother made an effort to clear one bedroom just enough for us to use before I arrive. I love him so I happily clean the whole house thinking i want him to come home to a nice comfortable place and he will see the difference.  But the deeper i clean, i more meth paraphernalia i discover. I was beyond furious. Now, my husband told me he was an ex addict and went to rehab and had been clean and sober for 3 years before we met. Maybe im stupid or just too inlove? Because i accepted him wholeheartedly and was actually appreciative that he told me that early on the relationship. Also, he is the most thougtful, sweet, kind, hard working person there is. Having a bad past is not something i judge a person on. But he said he never touched drug since so discovering these drugs and burned foil all over the house created a fight that made me almost fly back home. He said it  was from years before. BS! I can see some are fresh and hidden in places he has access to. His mom tried to talk to me in the middle of the fight but i shut her down immediately. At this point, i just lost total respect for her because I know she is the enabler (and a hoader on top of that!) Also, this fight was the first time in my life that I genuinely felt scared for my safety. Im in the middle of US, doensnt know anybody, cant work yet, cant drive yet and living in a hoarders house with an addict all alone by myself. Wtf?! This was the first chip. Fast forward us moving 6 hours away from his mom. My husband just landed a perfect career that he loves and I am now able to work because I have now a green card. We live in an upper middle class apartment complex that he enjoys a lot. Me, i honestly dont care. I would prefer for us moving somewhere cheap so we can save money and payoff some of the medical bills and buy a house. I tried talking to him about this over and over. Nothing goes through. He will just continually sya yes yes yes to me. Anyways, Our apartment is clean. We sometimes visit his mom. There was one time he told me after a visit, ""you know, now i understand why you cant use that bathroom before"". He can finally see the contrast of living in a hoarders house to a normal one. So i was hopeful. I can fully ascertain that he is no longer using drugs becuase they have random drug test at his job and he works all the time. On weekends we are mostly together. Comes the next fucking problem - money. His idea of investing and saving money is 401k and thats it. He has 2 xbox and switch and is planning to buy a playstation plus gazillion games he doesnt play. Normal for games i know but not when you are living paycheck to paycheck. Everytime i bring up the subject of saving and investing (because we have none) his brain would just shut off. Its getting to a point where it makes me want to buy a gun and just shoot myself in head than feel this frustration again and again and again. We would talk about budgeting our money. Its mostly me coming up with a plan that he will just say yes yes yes. Then a month later, he would forget about it (or pretend to forget about it?) Or flat out lie that we never discussed anything. Then we are back to figthing again. I went back to school and applied for a student loan. We have to use some of that money to get a new (used) car because almost all the money goes to this fucking apartment and credit cards he maxed out. Then there is this point that I made us a joint account, hoping that it will inspire him to save more once he sees the money accumulating. I put 500 there just to open it. One month later the 500 money is gone. Fight again. I asked him what did he used the money for? Answer: i dont know. I dont remember. Im sorry. I will do anything you say from now on. Rinse and repeat. Then there is this new credit card that i didnt know of that he maxed out so now we are absolutely royally  mega fucked. Fight again. Sorry. I will do anything you say. Please dont be mad anymore. Incant atand it when you are not talking to me. Rinse and repeat. At one point he opened a gamestop credit card. Fight again. Sorry. I will do anything you say from now on. That one i manage to close. Still, we are fucked financially. At this point, i have nothing but contempt. Is it even possibly to be addicted to an xbox? We are not having sex. I want to have a baby but I cannot due to our financial situation and we are not having sex anymore. Im no longer physically attracted to him. I find myself imagining dating someone else which never happend before. I asked for divorce once but he begged and begged and begged. His friends and family are all betting on each other on how long i will stay with him until i get the 10 year visa (which is on process at this time) because, according to them, i married him so i can move to US. Because it is such a stigma even to the country where im from, people would jokingly ask me (both americans and asians from my country, thailand) if i married him for the green card. I just wanted to sit and cry when they do that. I wanted to go back to school again ( i stopped and paying student loan now) but im not motivated anymore. I wanted a family in the beginning of our relationship not a fucking second degree. But i cannot have kids in this financial pit we are in that i feel like i will get a better job opportunity if i go finish a degree that is in demand which therefore bring more money and then i can finally have a kid. At this point i see my husband differently now. Im losing my respect and love for him and sometimes all i feel was sadness and pity. Pity for him being ignorant and for having a disfunctional mother. Pity for growing up in an ignorant home with an ignorant mother despite being in a country where there are opportunities everywhere. I never had a student loan before. I never had a credit card debt before. I never had.medical bills before. I was doing fine. Now, im fucked. He is not slow or stupid. He is just a lazy thinker and im not even sure what he is. Sometimes its even like a science experiment. I would try to observe him and noticed he responds well when we are eating out, spending money and generally having a good time (i know this is normal) but when i bring up the subject of saving money, just generally cutting the stuff we dont need, his total demeanor would change. Like its so literal and obvious change. He would endure me talking and explaining but its might as well i drag my nail on a chalkboard. Nothing is entering his brain. He would go on auto pilot and say yes yes yes. Even if i to talk about it while we are both in happy mood its the same reaction. He also cannot stand it when we are fighting and when im very angry. He would beg and do everything i say because he cannot stand being in an awkward situation where we dont talk to each other or discussing the possibility of divorce. At this point im not sure if this attitude of pathological lying and spending blindly is already ingrained in his being that there is no hope. When i see him with money, i can see the ""drug addict"" in him. Like, literally the way he puts it in his pocket and just the way he handles it, he was like dealing with drugs. I cant explain it but i see his whole body language. Its different. like somebody would steal it from him even if we are in the car and just withdrawing money from a drive tru atm. I know how much he makes and at one point im the one taking care of all our finances. I would ask him where the rest of his money goes, answer: i dont know.
 Its becoming too frustrating to the point of im ready for divorce. Then comes in his friends and family telling him i married him for the greencard. Honestly, i dont care what they think but i know my husband would try to beg and beg and beg for me to stay but the constant fighting over money and his lying is just making me dead inside. I never had depression before. I never considered seeing a therapist. Never in my life i feel clueless and hopeless. I dont know what to do. We cant afford a therapist. The end of rent is not due till after 8 months. I had to resign from my work because i am just too depress to continue. We have a baby dog. If i move back home, how and how much will it take to take him with me. How do i start all over again at 36 and where do i start rebuilding my life and career without money. I dont know what to do. We just had another fight today when i discovered he is using credit cards again when i told him not to.

,Divorce,"My divorce from my wife of 3 years was finalized a couple of months ago, and it was a kind of bitter divorce process, but once it was all over and I didnt have that instinct to protect myself and my livelihood, all I felt was sadness and emptiness in the place where anger used to sit (and before that, love).

To give a brief rundown of the marriage, we started dating when I was in the military, and got married pretty quickly. We got along amazingly well, almost never disagreeing on anything, and if we did we got over it. We spent every day together and had the same interests, played the same games, and just really loved each other.

I was asked Monday in our lobby how it was going. I answered that it was still very problematic and that she's been hell to deal with. I said however that I went on a date for the first time and while she wasn't the right person for me, it was still a lot of fun.

,Divorce,"I love the band Tool. By far one of the best bands that have ever existed and I wouldn’t be shocked if nothing like them comes out for a long time. However, moving passed praising them, I was listening to them this morning and on my playlist the song “The Grudge” pops up.

“Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity 
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate
Desperate to control all and everything
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen”

Maynard has hit close to home for me a lot throughout my life with his lyrics. Vicarious and H are big ones that deal with a lot of trauma and pain that I’ve witnessed or felt. This though, is something I really needed to hear. The entire song is letting go of grudges from yourself or even others and both are what I need in my life.

My ex had wronged me in our marriage and after it. I had loved her with all my heart and wanted to make things better for us and our children when I realized my issues (because I had them as well). However, looking into the affairs, the lies, finding letters she’d written about how ugly I was, and the list can go on, but I saw we weren’t really a “thing”. Now, I deal with my kids being told that I liked to hit her, that I’m black mailing her, her boyfriend telling them I don’t love them and that list of things can go on as well. A whole new set of problems I’ve dealt with this past year.

How they view me is something I can’t control. He doesn’t know me and she certainly doesn’t as well. When we fight she puts me into her trap of changing the subject to get me mad, and this is where I’m going with on learning to control and let go. I need to stay focused on my sons and making things better for them and showing my love for them. I can’t control the things that are said to them or the things my ex claims. I can only control myself.

I also need to just let go of the past. I know my ex doesn’t feel bad for the things that have been done. I know I’ve apologized though for my wrongs and I need to just move on with that. If she does I’ll accept it, but if she doesn’t it won’t change my life. In fact, I shouldn’t expect it and move on from all this hate and negativity that constantly follows me. I’ve gotten my life together and improved myself so much, but there is still that lingering blackness that doesn’t allow me to trust people. It doesn’t allow me to love myself.

Holding on to these grudges will do nothing but stop me from growing as a person. When that happens I find myself going back to my old bad habits. That is only hurting myself and going to hurt the relationship I have with my children. I need to do what. Just let go. Even when I think of it I can feel that negative weight just coming off of me.",t2_1s2d4r4,False,,0,False,Stop Wearing Your Grudges,[],r/Divorce,False,1,,0,False,t3_dfh882,False,dark,,public,15,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Life After Divorce,False,15,,,1570647294.0,,[],[],{},,True,,1570657401.0,text,1,,text,self.Divorce,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the band Tool.

There's no other person. I am just completely fed up with his lies and betrayal. Mostly with finances. He's a spender. He spends way beyond what we both make.

I was furious but didn&amp;#39;t press further because I kept thinking it was my fault for not contributing years before. But he kept spending and spending. I opened my own bank account so he won&amp;#39;t be able to use my paychecks. I&amp;#39;ve covered his NSF so many times. Sometimes I put my own account in jeopardy just so I can help him out with his fees. He doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk about our money situation at all. Whenever I bring it up he gives me a guilt trip. I feel so defeated and disappointed in him. He applied for loans under my name and don&amp;#39;t pay the bill. I find out when creditors start calling my phone. Once a constable even showed up to serve my court papers. He messed up my credit and I can&amp;#39;t take it anymore. I just want a divorce and start over with my kids. I don&amp;#39;t want anything to do with him anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"I'm so over it all finally. It has been a while since the ex and I divorced. It was traumatic, I was suicidal, I thought I'd surely not survive the pain I was in. There were custody fights after the fact over our youngest (12 yo). We had been together since high school, marriage lasted 24 years. The way he was treating me after we broke up I wondered if he ever loved me at all. He'd been an absentee husband/father. Focused on his job, and earning a paycheck. I got that and I supported him and kept the home fires burning and basically raised the kids by myself. Obviously he came home sometimes, we had 4 kids. I was a frugal wife and I did go back to work when the kids were all in school. I kept myself in shape too and was always available to him and understanding of the stress he was under with his job. Then he moved us far away from our home for a job opportunity with promises of better paychecks, better life.  That's when he really disappeared. His job became #1. His career and how he looked to the outside world became his focus. He actually would lie about where we lived to people to make them think we were rich. I just kept smiling when I was by his side, usually at a business function, and listen to him exaggerate our home, our kids accomplishment etc. Who was this man? I wondered to myself. I no longer recognized him. He worked long hours and traveled extensively on business. Once when he was in Italy with his boss, he was telling me how cheap gold was there. He was telling me about how much jewelry his boss was buying for his girlfriend. When he got home he had a gift for me. A long skinny box. ""A necklace!"" is what I was thinking to myself. I excitedly opened the box. It was a pen. A nice pen, but it was a pen. I've seen the displays in the airport for these pens. I'm certain that's where he purchased it. But I digress, as usual. My point in writing this down again is to tell you that It has taken me almost 20 years to really get over him. I moved on with my life certainly, but he haunted my dreams and my thoughts almost daily. I remarried an extremely lovely man pretty quickly after the divorce, 3 years. He and I were divorce buddies seeing each other through the trauma of our divorces. I may not have survived without him. He feels the same of me.

I can't tell you how many times over the years how a memory of him brought me to fresh tears yet again. I had invested myself in that life with him completely.

I left the apartment we rented from his parents to give him some space and went to stay with my parents.  I was thinking we needed a few days - but he knew that what he really wanted was a divorce.  I accused him of cheating with his new secretary (gut instinct), he told me I was wrong.  For two years he strung along the divorce process and during that time allowed me to believe I was crazy for thinking there was anyone else, allowed me to blame myself.  In hindsight, he knew that as long as I blamed myself I would not ask for anything in the divorce.  And he was right, I didn't.  In fact, I gave him my tax return money because I knew he needed it.  Finally, we divorced this February and no sooner than the ink was dry do I find out that I was right all along - it was the secretary.  

Mutual friend: While we were still dating he became friends with another guy, we'll call him Bob.  Bob was single at the time but then a few months later started dating a woman, we'll call her Sally.  Bob and my husband became best friends.  Sally and I became best friends.

I cannot stomach being at the same party as him and the girl I was right about.  I used to bring her lunch.  It's too much for me.  When I found out that he had been seeing the secretary, I texted my best friend, upset because I felt a different layer of betrayal.  Her response ""I'm sorry you're upset.""

,Divorce,"My aunt (48F) filed a petition for divorce against her husband (49M) who has received the summon and signed it.

She has been a victim of domestic violence with constant threats to her life, from her husband. They have been married for 23 years and have always stayed in California.

Both of them along with their daughter(age: 21) own a house with no mortgage on it.

My uncle is a patient of bipolar disorder and has recently withdrawn all money from their joint accounts before signing the summon. He also has plans to move his funds out of the country to India. Currently, he is unemployed but has intermittently worked in contracts at Microsoft, Intel and other big companies with great pay. (~$100k) He has several accounts in Indian banks. They are green card holders and are yet to receive citizenship.

My aunt is an esthetician and owns a salon and earns around $40k. Since he hardly goes to work the income comes around to be the same according to my aunt.

As per the summon he has to respond within 30 days.

Q1. What happens if he doesn't respond?

Q2. If he responds and asks for an attorney, would my aunt have to bear the costs as he is unemployed at the moment?

Q3. He has already taken out funds from their joint accounts before signing the petition, what happens if he doesn't declare his assets for equal distribution? Does CA state law take any action if he declines to disclose his assets? How can my aunt ensure she gets equal portion of the funds?

Q4. What if he leaves the country and doesn't respond to the subsequent summons and reminders?

Q5. What steps are required to be taken by my aunt to ensure a quick and favorable settlment agreement. What are the key points required for a better negotiation? She wants to save on her money and wants a quick settlement.

Q6. Can she get free legal advice to lower her attorney fees?

Q7. Since my aunt and her daughter are joint owners of the house along with my uncle, what is the probability of getting the house as she would rather want to keep the house instead of money.

Q8. Will his daughter be entitled to receive monetary support for completing her education?

&lt;p&gt;Q2. If he responds and asks for an attorney, would my aunt have to bear the costs as he is unemployed at the moment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q3. He has already taken out funds from their joint accounts before signing the petition, what happens if he doesn&amp;#39;t declare his assets for equal distribution? Does CA state law take any action if he declines to disclose his assets? How can my aunt ensure she gets equal portion of the funds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q4. What if he leaves the country and doesn&amp;#39;t respond to the subsequent summons and reminders?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q5. What steps are required to be taken by my aunt to ensure a quick and favorable settlment agreement. What are the key points required for a better negotiation? She wants to save on her money and wants a quick settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q6. Can she get free legal advice to lower her attorney fees?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q7. Since my aunt and her daughter are joint owners of the house along with my uncle, what is the probability of getting the house as she would rather want to keep the house instead of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q8. Will his daughter be entitled to receive monetary support for completing her education?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s most probably leaving her current attorney as she can&amp;#39;t afford the fees, any answer to even a single question would be appreciated! Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"My wife (33F) and I (32M) have been married for almost 9 years and have 2 kids (5M &amp; 3F). We got married in the first year of me being in the military and everything was perfect for the first 4-5 years. We communicated, we had a active sex life, we enjoyed spending time together, had our oldest child, and started raising him. I was also deployed overseas for 9 months before she was pregnant with him and everything was great. Then my wife got pregnant a few months before my second deployment. During my second deployment we talked almost daily but our relationship was hard for me because my wife wouldn't let me see her naked over Facetime and didn't want to try to have some intimacy while I was on the other side of the world. This was never a problem during the first deployment and made me kind of wonder what changed. Our relationship was built with a very strong basis on intimacy and it seemed to go from 100 to 0 real quick. I managed to come home for the birth of our daughter and we were happy but once I went back everything changed. For the last 3 months I was gone our daughter cried a lot and it was very difficult on my wife but she was close to family and they helped as much as they could. I started to worry about her and the kids a lot because of how much stress she was under. Once I came back this continued. Intimacy was nonexistent, I worried about my wife and kids daily and I became depressed as well. For a while I honestly was worried I would come home and my wife would be dead. She wasn't happy being a stay at home parent and she has issues with staying calm and being patient with the kids. We eventually decided her working and putting the kids in daycare was the best decision. She was working from home but she didn't have to worry about the kids while I was working. I took the kids every morning and brought them back every evening. I really thought this would help and would restrengthen our relationship but it didn't. We argued a lot, and intimacy was pretty much nonexistent still. We would cuddle for maybe a minute and she would tell me it's to hot go away and sex was a chore. I got turned down 95% of the time and she never tried. I tried talking about it and was always told she just had no sex drive. After a year or so she told me she hated working from home as she couldn't concentrate on work and would get distracted by the dirty house or would just sit on the couch and binge watch Netflix. So she quit working from home and got a job and she seemed much happier. Intimacy and sex still stayed the same though and I still got the same reason. She just don't have a desire to have sex. This continued until we moved and brings us to current day. She found a job very quickly making good money and was extremely happy with work and even started going to school. I spend 2-3 evenings during the week alone with the kids while she works or goes to study hall. I also watch them for part of Saturday and Sunday while she works.  I was a lot happier with work and was able to be home more. Then one day she told me she was going to a study group but I found out that she didn't. I ended up confronting her and she came clean and told me she met with a guy who was married from one of her classes and they talked about marriage and life. She said nothing happened and he was just a friend who she could talk to. I was hurt that she won't talk to me about the issues but can talk to someone she's known for 1 1/2  month. I also wondered if there was more to it. The next day I decided to check her texting history and noticed she was texting the same number pretty much all day. During work, during school,  and at home. I was infuriated, hurt, and broken. I decided I had to know what was going on and decided to login to her account and read the messages. My whole world came crashing down. It wasn't the guy from class though, it was a guy at work. She was telling him how she hates being around me and she hates kissing me. She told him how wet he got her and how badly she wanted to have sex with him right then and there and that she had to just take care of it herself during her break. This really hurt because she always told me that I shouldn't masturbate and that if I did it was because she wasn't taking care of me. When she got home I confronted her and I told her how hurt I was. We talked about our lack of communication and I told her I wanted to work on our marriage and try to fall in love again but that I don't think I could do it without her quitting her job. I told her we would make due without the extra money, we would go to counseling, and figure everything out but I needed her to decided if she wanted to make sacrifices in order to build up my trust. She said she couldn't and that it was over. I was devastated and just wanted to run away. The next day was hard. I was alone with the kids(Weekend) and she was at work most of the day. When she got home I was clearly broken and she didn't care. After the kids went to bed we talked again. We talked about our personal problems, our marriage problems, all the things we haven't been telling each other about. I felt like we connected on some level and I told her I wanted to work things out. I told her she could keep the job, I wouldn't check her messaged anymore and I was scheduling marriage counseling. She said talking helps but that she needs time to think and figure stuff out. The last few days I've talked to her briefly during lunch and at home when the kids are in bed. I've done everything I can around the house and have tried to just be there for her. This morning I asked her if I was giving her enough space and she said no. I felt like the last several days were a complete waste and all I did was build myself up so that I could get broke down again and didn't know what to do. I don't want to leave my home and my kids. She said she doesn't want me sleeping on the couch. Maybe we need to just switch off days and not be around each other during the evenings once the kids are asleep. I honestly don't know anymore and I can't get her to tell me exactly what she want or needs. I truly want to make this marriage work. I feel that we can fall in love again and learn to love one another. Our oldest was just diagnosed with Autism and he needs all the support and stability he can get. I've realized that I can do more around the house and it actually makes me feel better after a hard day at work. It gives me that sense of accomplishment and pride. But I feel like nothing makes a different or matters. I'm scared that she'll have primary custody of the kids and she won't be able to handle the extra responsibility and they will suffer. Normally I get them ready in the morning and pick them up in the afternoon. This morning she had to get our daughter ready by herself and she was on the verge of yelling at her. If she had to get both kids ready I think she would have lost it. Our son refuses to ride in the car with her in the morning so she has to take our daughter. But she doesn't want to deal with her, I honestly think my wife prefers our son so much over our daughter that it's effecting her. Just the other day our daughter told me after school that she didn't want to see mommy and that she didn't love her. Maybe it's time to separate myself and start to move on but I'm terrified for my children's well being. I don't think my wife can handle being a single mother. I think she'll come running back after a few months and I don't know if I'll be able to forgive her after its all said and done. Especially since I see a long and hard custody battle ahead because I will fight tooth and nail to have 50/50 custody of my children. I honestly don't know what to do anymore and I'm hoping someone will be able to help. If you made it this far I applaud you and would really enjoy your insight, opinion, and advise even if it's something I probably don't want to hear. Maybe I'm not as good of a husband and person as I previously though but I do know I'm a damn good father and would do anything for my children.",t2_4redg6yn,False,,0,False,Hurt and Confused.

I know that if I continue with the divorce, she will go right back into that funk and it worries me greatly but then again, I just want to stay being the old happy me and I know if I go back to that relationship, counseling or not, I won’t be me. I won’t be happy with life near as much as I am now.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re both quite young also. Both 22.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"I'm 30, been with the same guy since 2009 (after getting away from a very abusive family), been married since 2012, no kids, and we've been renting all this time from his parents while living in their basement. Turns out I entered another abusive environment, and stupid naive me believed it would either not be so bad, get better eventually and we could get married anyway and it'd all magically work out as long as two people loved each other.

tldr: Go to ""Conclusion"" at bottom

I'm thinking of divorcing him because of a variety of reasons on his part (from biggest issue first):

1. No trust towards me. He doesn't trust me ever since he caught me watching porn back in 2011, he equates porn to cheating, says I'm looking at other men whenever we're in public (so it makes me not ever want to go outside the house, or makes me see everything from a negative light - See #2), and fails on re-building trust in me regardless of me not watching it anymore. There's no progress regarding this no matter how many free therapy sessions he reluctantly receives from his work or the town's church (which we don't attend, but they give free services in hopes you'll convert). He seems to come out of every session as damaged as he went in, and he won't share anything or very little from them because ""they're private"".
2. He doesn't prioritize in treating or improving my debilitating mental issues. I've been suffering from issues which he's aware of, caused by family neglect or something I was simply born with, yet he always has some excuse to not get me seen yet. My issues have caused me to not only struggle losing/forgetting/misplacing things, behaving under authority, struggle throughout school, drop out of college, but fail to get or keep a job -- by making me distracted 24/7, dose off appearing as if I'm there but not really, general anxiety, mood high's and low's, hyper-reactivity, etc. I'm even at risk of rear-ending someone on the road or hitting pedestrians, because of said issue(s), so I can't drive the car he uses to go to work. Employers who hire me like me at first, but after seeing my screw-up's lose trust in me and don't have the heart to fire me, so they instead cut my hours and tasks to the point where I get depressed/angry and see no point in going anymore. I give my 2 weeks notice, they immediately show a look of immense relief, and don't even want to wait the two weeks to replace me. Rinse and repeat. My resume now has huge gaps which apparently cause me to fail passing the 1st interview stage. He is well aware of my handicaps yet doesn't want to focus on getting me treated. I've pushed him to prioritize me seeing someone, but he's never able to drive me because he's always busy at work. I have to schedule a day and time that works for him. Uber, taxi, friends and walking are off the table (See #4). My issues have made me extremely self-aware and doubt myself, because I try to figure out how I can circumvent them or at least live with them, and I just sit in the basement of his parents' house all day.
3. Violent In-denial Borderline Alcoholic: He sees drinking as a form of happiness. When he’s drank too much, he becomes hyperactive in speech, disoriented, passive-aggressive and more controlling than he is sober. If I continue pressing, the situation with him becomes even more toxic, his violence can become physical, sometimes his parents get involved because they hear screaming in the basement, every blue moon even the police get involved, and the next day he acts like it's no big deal. It doesn’t take that many drinks to affect him, yet he swears to his mother’s grave that it takes multiple times that amount to make him feel buzzed at best. When I confront him about drinking too much, he gets into a physical rage whenever I confront the issue. I know his urge to drink is due to underlying issues he's dealing with, but he refuses to even talk about WTF he's dealing with mentally that would cause him to drink that way in the first place.
4. Takes away my freedom, independence and joy of life: he has zero interest in friends, only interest in acquaintences and ""business transactions"". He's dead-against non-mutual friends, because he doesn't want to ""bust his ass while I'm having fun"" and/or thinks I might cheat on him. So in other words, we've made ZERO friends the entire time we've been together since 2009. He doesn't allow me to make any, and if I make one in an online game, he gets very jealous and repeatedly tells me to stop chatting with them. I don't have a cell phone, only a laptop which he is weary of what I use it for while he's at work. My credit card was suspended and my credit score is in the dumps because he treated the card like a gift card or something, and it seems he has no interest in fixing either despite my begging. He won't allow me to leave or even walk outside the house. And I can't so much as go outside for fresh air or anything, because if he finds out he freaks out, thinking I was meeting some guy or something. And God forbid I don't answer his phone calls, which he makes from work a few times or so a day, because he starts thinking I'm up to something. I no longer want to feel like in a prison, and I want to feel like there’s a way out. I don’t want to feel like I’m trapped or stuck. That's how he makes me feel, and my sister, her bf and my dad all see that (See Conclusion)
5. He still wants me and him to have zero contact with my family: He saw the residual trauma in me from my family, and while him bunching them all together as off-limits made sense, cutting my sister along with them doesn't. I have to talk to her via Google Hangouts because of no cell phone, and if he comes home while I'm talking to her, I have to hang up or he gets upset. Even if it's her birthday. She is the only blood family member still in my life besides my dad who I talk to 1-2x per year (for obvious reasons I guess), and she is the only person in my life who understands what we went through growing up with family abuse. And yet my husband wishes she were dead. The main reason for his logic, in his own words, is that she deserves no respect or forgiveness because she has a history of drug abuse and abandoned her kids in favor of it, and was incarcerated for various misdemeanors and felonies. For the last 6 years she’s been clean and out of trouble, and has rekindled healthy relationships with her kids. A few years back he promised to kindle a relationship with her once that happened, but he never kept his promise. He speaks the worst about her, like as if she killed his family or burned his house down, while he acts like he has the purity of the Pope while being cordial with strangers at work, the local gas station, etc who probably don't have much better criminal records.
6. Issues galore...

a) *Immature:* not letting go of something he was looking forward to in failed plans, trying to compensate for it. He wants pizza for dinner one night, it doesn't work out for some reason, and there he is eating a pizza slice defrosted from the freezer.

b) *Codependent:* I can't tell him to go to the store to get something for me, because whenever he goes to the store, he NEEDS me there like as if we're Siamese twins or attached at the hip.  I can't be in a separate room from him without him going nuts and following me wherever I go. Even if I go in a separate isle in a grocery store, there he goes following me. If I dash to the bathroom or something, he eventually runs into me questioning me angrily.

c) *Arrogant:* Thinks highly about himself, which are hardly true due to living a life full of lies and excuses about anything and everything, and taking no accountability for his wrongs.

d) *Selfish and controlling:* Plans trips without my consent each and every time, and no matter how much I beg him to stop, he still does it. Any activity I’m doing that doesn’t involve him, and he has to but in with a “what about me?” attitude instead of just leaving me alone. Example 1: Q: I’m going to go hang out with friends at the mall/bookstore/etc. A: ""I don’t work like a mule to support you wasting time with friends."" Example 2: Q: I want to go out and get a job and enroll back in school. A: ""I’m not your dad so I’m not going to support your tuition or transportation.""  Example 3: What did you do with my iPad from the contest? ""I sold it to a co-worker. You're too wired.""

e) *OCD on steroids:* Moves around or throws away things that he thinks make a dirty looking living space, and infuriates me when he does it. He threw away my invention concept sketches because according to him, it looked ""cluttered."" On an almost daily basis, I cannot find things I’m looking for because he either moved them or threw them away. When I ask him about where he moved the thing I’m looking for, he says he has NO idea. He’s not even aware of where he puts my things, he just does it.

f) *Weird Possessive Anger:* After getting angry at me, he grabs something of mine that bothers him and unconsciously hides that thing where even he cannot find it when he’s not angry anymore. Among these things are: 1. the camera which he thinks I use to take selfies and share with friends or men, which angers him; 2. My lotion which he thinks I don’t need and it just makes all things I touch greasy or sticky, which further triggers his OCD; 3. the iPad I won.

g) *Bad Hygiene, Grooming &amp; Habits:* he's morbidly obese at 5'11"" and 290 lbs. I try to help him lose the weight and no matter how I approach it, it always ends up as a fight because he doesn't trust my advice and his relationship with food is too strong. Because of his body weight, he refuses to ever wear pants outside of work due to how hot it makes him, even if it’s snowing or he’s the only person in the entire town wearing shorts because everyone else finds it’s too cold. I recommend he does yoga to get more flexible and possibly lose weight, but he refuses to do it because it's lame. He wears his casual shoes like slip-ons, ruining the part that wraps around the heel, because he’s too stiff to simply bend over and put them on correctly. He just stands in the shower every morning wasting water and electricity instead of hurrying up let alone reaching to clean parts of him because he’s not flexible enough. Thus, he cleans all his areas with the towel after hopping out, STAINING the towel with body stains because he didn’t wash in the shower! Breathes from his mouth all the time, wheezes when he exhales, and there’s always phlegm in his throat that he has to cough out -- and he refuses to do that too. He has to sleep on his stomach or he will choke with sleep apnea or who knows what. When he walks, he swings his hips because either he’s so large, or it’s habitual. When he walks he also swings his arms but only the part from the elbow down despite my every effort to try getting him to stop. When he has a zit, he keeps picking at it until it’s a huge red scab that takes several weeks to heal, rather than letting me treat it or simply leave it alone and go away on its own. When he has a hair on his eyebrow he doesn’t like, he ends up with a bald spot on his eyebrow because he hand-picked at it instead of letting me get to it. He's 80% bald and ruins his hair by wearing his hat wrong.

h) *Paranoid:* He swears that I ""looked at that guy just now"" when I obviously didn't. Things I say quietly to him, he says others 10ft+ away can hear. This only gets worse when he's stressed or anxious.

i) *Nervous Ticks:* He cocks his head up about half an inch suddenly ever so often, more often when relaxed or driving. He wiggles his jaw when excited, etc. Has spoonerisms or a very targeted dyslexia (eg ""look at that tire fruck"" or ""this place has a small chown tarm""). Doesn't bring up any of it as a concern in his sessions, based on what he's told me.

i) *Habitual Liar:* Denies eating a plate of food after dinner each time I confront him about it. Takes the car out and never tells me, and when I ask him about it he denies ever taking the car. He talks or interacts with people much more than he tells me. Example: Grocery store staff say they always see him yet never see me, which IMO isn't possible since AFAIK we always go to the store together. He comes into the house with alcohol smelling breath, and I can tell he’s had a generous amount by his actions (See #3). But he denies it or says something stupid like “I was testing an old bottle to see if it was still good’.

**Wrapping Up:** I am concerned with the way I’m seeing things, and my sister her boyfriend and even my dad see it. None of them have ever even met the guy. They’ve all seen things I've said or shown about my husband that have made them question. I had to take mental note of that, even if they weren’t the ones married to him. My sister's okay with where I am and who I'm with, but as time progressed and things happened, things my husband has done and said, that didn't keep her opinion of him from changing drastically and in a bad direction. It’s not her fault. She believes that he \*is\* keeping me safe, but ""from What or Whom?"" She says that he has serious control issues, and her fear is that he is controlling me to an extent that that’s why I have no real genuine freedom.

I guess she is mostly right when it comes to that. I can’t come and go as I please, I can’t have friends mutual or otherwise, or friends that I had from high school who don’t know him, any person I could have as a friend, a job I chose, a school or education if I so chose, etc. The fact that I can’t go out in the driveway and get fresh air without worry of repercussions if he were to come home and find me outside and not in the basement. I can’t go to the store to get stuff to prepare a dinner at the spur of the moment, because something sounded good or I saw something on TV that I wanted to make, and I wanted to surprise him. And so I could just go to the store and purchase what I wanted or needed, and there'd be no fear of repercussions or consequences for doing so, and she and I know I can’t do that. She and I both know that his control is abnormal and past overbearing, and she is afraid that he is just trying to alienate me even further from my family and the world in general. But she says that if me being with him makes me happy, then so be it, because I am an adult who can make those decisions for myself, and she is right. I feel love for him (I've been with him since 2009, how could I not?), but I'm not stupid.

My choice to be married to him is my choice. I’m an adult and my mental issues aside, I believe I'm capable enough to make these decisions. But on the other hand I don’t trust his judgment, and I don't entirely trust my own.

**Conclusion:** If I end up divorcing him, it's due to the above numbered issues. I'll go back from New Jersey to California to be close in proximity to my sister, myself being still messed up in the head I guess, but I'll hope for the best. I've come to terms with that idea without so much fear, because I value my dignity and independence more than my marriage. I feel like it would take a miracle for me seeing myself spending the rest of my life with him, because he's so unwilling to change. You cannot help others who are unwilling to help themselves.

The thing is that if I file for divorce and physically manage to leave him, I'll have no cushion to fall back on. Due to his obsessive/codependent nature, he probably won't sign the divorce papers without a fight. As far as divorce agreements go, I want nothing from him, not even a single cent. All I really have my name on is his life insurance policy, but I couldn't care less. If I take the plunge, I just want to get away. I don't know where I'll be able to live, if I'll be homeless or starving. My sister is there for me, but she has her own life to deal with and I don't want to intrude so as to not risk her getting involved in my potential mess. She lives not the most stable life which scares me too, because I think her sobriety would be at risk if I come in her life with my drama. She loves me, and she said that wherever I’m at, because she's my sister and she knows how awful it feels to be stuck, I have a place in her home. But I know better, so I basically have NOBODY. **And without the divorce papers signed, I don't know if I'll qualify for any financial aid of any kind, such as the ability to see a mental health professional to get a diagnosis and treatment, so I can at least try getting back to work.**

My credit card was suspended and my credit score is in the dumps because he treated the card like a gift card or something, and it seems he has no interest in fixing either despite my begging. He won&amp;#39;t allow me to leave or even walk outside the house. And I can&amp;#39;t so much as go outside for fresh air or anything, because if he finds out he freaks out, thinking I was meeting some guy or something. And God forbid I don&amp;#39;t answer his phone calls, which he makes from work a few times or so a day, because he starts thinking I&amp;#39;m up to something. I no longer want to feel like in a prison, and I want to feel like there’s a way out. I don’t want to feel like I’m trapped or stuck. That&amp;#39;s how he makes me feel, and my sister, her bf and my dad all see that (See Conclusion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He still wants me and him to have zero contact with my family: He saw the residual trauma in me from my family, and while him bunching them all together as off-limits made sense, cutting my sister along with them doesn&amp;#39;t. I have to talk to her via Google Hangouts because of no cell phone, and if he comes home while I&amp;#39;m talking to her, I have to hang up or he gets upset. Even if it&amp;#39;s her birthday. She is the only blood family member still in my life besides my dad who I talk to 1-2x per year (for obvious reasons I guess), and she is the only person in my life who understands what we went through growing up with family abuse. And yet my husband wishes she were dead. The main reason for his logic, in his own words, is that she deserves no respect or forgiveness because she has a history of drug abuse and abandoned her kids in favor of it, and was incarcerated for various misdemeanors and felonies. For the last 6 years she’s been clean and out of trouble, and has rekindled healthy relationships with her kids. A few years back he promised to kindle a relationship with her once that happened, but he never kept his promise. He speaks the worst about her, like as if she killed his family or burned his house down, while he acts like he has the purity of the Pope while being cordial with strangers at work, the local gas station, etc who probably don&amp;#39;t have much better criminal records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues galore...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) &lt;em&gt;Immature:&lt;/em&gt; not letting go of something he was looking forward to in failed plans, trying to compensate for it. He wants pizza for dinner one night, it doesn&amp;#39;t work out for some reason, and there he is eating a pizza slice defrosted from the freezer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) &lt;em&gt;Codependent:&lt;/em&gt; I can&amp;#39;t tell him to go to the store to get something for me, because whenever he goes to the store, he NEEDS me there like as if we&amp;#39;re Siamese twins or attached at the hip.  I can&amp;#39;t be in a separate room from him without him going nuts and following me wherever I go. Even if I go in a separate isle in a grocery store, there he goes following me. If I dash to the bathroom or something, he eventually runs into me questioning me angrily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) &lt;em&gt;Arrogant:&lt;/em&gt; Thinks highly about himself, which are hardly true due to living a life full of lies and excuses about anything and everything, and taking no accountability for his wrongs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d) &lt;em&gt;Selfish and controlling:&lt;/em&gt; Plans trips without my consent each and every time, and no matter how much I beg him to stop, he still does it. Any activity I’m doing that doesn’t involve him, and he has to but in with a “what about me?” attitude instead of just leaving me alone. Example 1: Q: I’m going to go hang out with friends at the mall/bookstore/etc. A: &amp;quot;I don’t work like a mule to support you wasting time with friends.&amp;quot; Example 2: Q: I want to go out and get a job and enroll back in school. A: &amp;quot;I’m not your dad so I’m not going to support your tuition or transportation.&amp;quot;  Example 3: What did you do with my iPad from the contest? &amp;quot;I sold it to a co-worker. You&amp;#39;re too wired.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e) &lt;em&gt;OCD on steroids:&lt;/em&gt; Moves around or throws away things that he thinks make a dirty looking living space, and infuriates me when he does it. He threw away my invention concept sketches because according to him, it looked &amp;quot;cluttered.&amp;quot; On an almost daily basis, I cannot find things I’m looking for because he either moved them or threw them away. When I ask him about where he moved the thing I’m looking for, he says he has NO idea. He’s not even aware of where he puts my things, he just does it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;f) &lt;em&gt;Weird Possessive Anger:&lt;/em&gt; After getting angry at me, he grabs something of mine that bothers him and unconsciously hides that thing where even he cannot find it when he’s not angry anymore. Among these things are: 1. the camera which he thinks I use to take selfies and share with friends or men, which angers him; 2. My lotion which he thinks I don’t need and it just makes all things I touch greasy or sticky, which further triggers his OCD; 3. the iPad I won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;g) &lt;em&gt;Bad Hygiene, Grooming &amp;amp; Habits:&lt;/em&gt; he&amp;#39;s morbidly obese at 5&amp;#39;11&amp;quot; and 290 lbs. I try to help him lose the weight and no matter how I approach it, it always ends up as a fight because he doesn&amp;#39;t trust my advice and his relationship with food is too strong. Because of his body weight, he refuses to ever wear pants outside of work due to how hot it makes him, even if it’s snowing or he’s the only person in the entire town wearing shorts because everyone else finds it’s too cold. I recommend he does yoga to get more flexible and possibly lose weight, but he refuses to do it because it&amp;#39;s lame. He wears his casual shoes like slip-ons, ruining the part that wraps around the heel, because he’s too stiff to simply bend over and put them on correctly. He just stands in the shower every morning wasting water and electricity instead of hurrying up let alone reaching to clean parts of him because he’s not flexible enough. Thus, he cleans all his areas with the towel after hopping out, STAINING the towel with body stains because he didn’t wash in the shower! Breathes from his mouth all the time, wheezes when he exhales, and there’s always phlegm in his throat that he has to cough out -- and he refuses to do that too. He has to sleep on his stomach or he will choke with sleep apnea or who knows what. When he walks, he swings his hips because either he’s so large, or it’s habitual. When he walks he also swings his arms but only the part from the elbow down despite my every effort to try getting him to stop. When he has a zit, he keeps picking at it until it’s a huge red scab that takes several weeks to heal, rather than letting me treat it or simply leave it alone and go away on its own. When he has a hair on his eyebrow he doesn’t like, he ends up with a bald spot on his eyebrow because he hand-picked at it instead of letting me get to it. He&amp;#39;s 80% bald and ruins his hair by wearing his hat wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;h) &lt;em&gt;Paranoid:&lt;/em&gt; He swears that I &amp;quot;looked at that guy just now&amp;quot; when I obviously didn&amp;#39;t. Things I say quietly to him, he says others 10ft+ away can hear. This only gets worse when he&amp;#39;s stressed or anxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i) &lt;em&gt;Nervous Ticks:&lt;/em&gt; He cocks his head up about half an inch suddenly ever so often, more often when relaxed or driving. He wiggles his jaw when excited, etc. Has spoonerisms or a very targeted dyslexia (eg &amp;quot;look at that tire fruck&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;this place has a small chown tarm&amp;quot;). Doesn&amp;#39;t bring up any of it as a concern in his sessions, based on what he&amp;#39;s told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i) &lt;em&gt;Habitual Liar:&lt;/em&gt; Denies eating a plate of food after dinner each time I confront him about it. Takes the car out and never tells me, and when I ask him about it he denies ever taking the car. He talks or interacts with people much more than he tells me. Example: Grocery store staff say they always see him yet never see me, which IMO isn&amp;#39;t possible since AFAIK we always go to the store together. He comes into the house with alcohol smelling breath, and I can tell he’s had a generous amount by his actions (See #3). But he denies it or says something stupid like “I was testing an old bottle to see if it was still good’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping Up:&lt;/strong&gt; I am concerned with the way I’m seeing things, and my sister her boyfriend and even my dad see it. None of them have ever even met the guy. They’ve all seen things I&amp;#39;ve said or shown about my husband that have made them question. I had to take mental note of that, even if they weren’t the ones married to him. My sister&amp;#39;s okay with where I am and who I&amp;#39;m with, but as time progressed and things happened, things my husband has done and said, that didn&amp;#39;t keep her opinion of him from changing drastically and in a bad direction. It’s not her fault. She believes that he *is* keeping me safe, but &amp;quot;from What or Whom?&amp;quot; She says that he has serious control issues, and her fear is that he is controlling me to an extent that that’s why I have no real genuine freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess she is mostly right when it comes to that. I can’t come and go as I please, I can’t have friends mutual or otherwise, or friends that I had from high school who don’t know him, any person I could have as a friend, a job I chose, a school or education if I so chose, etc. The fact that I can’t go out in the driveway and get fresh air without worry of repercussions if he were to come home and find me outside and not in the basement. I can’t go to the store to get stuff to prepare a dinner at the spur of the moment, because something sounded good or I saw something on TV that I wanted to make, and I wanted to surprise him. And so I could just go to the store and purchase what I wanted or needed, and there&amp;#39;d be no fear of repercussions or consequences for doing so, and she and I know I can’t do that. She and I both know that his control is abnormal and past overbearing, and she is afraid that he is just trying to alienate me even further from my family and the world in general. But she says that if me being with him makes me happy, then so be it, because I am an adult who can make those decisions for myself, and she is right. I feel love for him (I&amp;#39;ve been with him since 2009, how could I not?), but I&amp;#39;m not stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My choice to be married to him is my choice. I’m an adult and my mental issues aside, I believe I&amp;#39;m capable enough to make these decisions. But on the other hand I don’t trust his judgment, and I don&amp;#39;t entirely trust my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; If I end up divorcing him, it&amp;#39;s due to the above numbered issues. I&amp;#39;ll go back from New Jersey to California to be close in proximity to my sister, myself being still messed up in the head I guess, but I&amp;#39;ll hope for the best. I&amp;#39;ve come to terms with that idea without so much fear, because I value my dignity and independence more than my marriage. I feel like it would take a miracle for me seeing myself spending the rest of my life with him, because he&amp;#39;s so unwilling to change. You cannot help others who are unwilling to help themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is that if I file for divorce and physically manage to leave him, I&amp;#39;ll have no cushion to fall back on. Due to his obsessive/codependent nature, he probably won&amp;#39;t sign the divorce papers without a fight. As far as divorce agreements go, I want nothing from him, not even a single cent. All I really have my name on is his life insurance policy, but I couldn&amp;#39;t care less. If I take the plunge, I just want to get away. I don&amp;#39;t know where I&amp;#39;ll be able to live, if I&amp;#39;ll be homeless or starving. My sister is there for me, but she has her own life to deal with and I don&amp;#39;t want to intrude so as to not risk her getting involved in my potential mess. She lives not the most stable life which scares me too, because I think her sobriety would be at risk if I come in her life with my drama. She loves me, and she said that wherever I’m at, because she&amp;#39;s my sister and she knows how awful it feels to be stuck, I have a place in her home. But I know better, so I basically have NOBODY. &lt;strong&gt;And without the divorce papers signed, I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll qualify for any financial aid of any kind, such as the ability to see a mental health professional to get a diagnosis and treatment, so I can at least try getting back to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. Any advice welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Hi everyone.

Not sure if this is meant for this sub or r/Marriage but I'm gonna shoot my shot in hopes that someone will help me. It's not concerning me but about my family - my parents to be more precise. A little background would be that they are together now for about 35 years and there have been changes in the role of who has been getting the finances in the home in the past 2 decades. Both of them have been thru tough times and in desperate need of each other but it seems as tho my dad was always more supportive towards my mom than the other way around. He gave up on a lot of life opportunities just so their marriage and our family would work out. My mom on the other hand has been very unconscious about what she is doing in life always leaning towards politics and her career (she is now a Regional Director of Forestry in our country) and leaving out her personal relationships. Her relationship with her parents (my grandparents) is long gone as of now and that's one of the factors why my granddad has been drinking every day for the past months/years.. Fast forward 2 months ago, my dad got suspicious about my mom lying (she does it quite often, but this time it was more strangely and secretively) so he installed a voice recorded on her phones and stumbled upon conversations she has had with some guy who is a different Regional Director. Still officially not sure if she is having an affair because she shrugs him off with his talks about new love, but I generally believe there is no smoke without fire. This whole situation made my sister cut all communication with my mom. My dad has been devastated for the past 2 months and very emotional since he is feeling he wasted 35 years of his life.. and this is the main reason it hurts me..

,Divorce,"Okay sorry it's not a strict divorce, and I'm sorry if it goes against the rules of the board but I just needed somewhere to go. I've been with my girlfriend for 11 years, and for all intents and purposes we've pretty much been married. We live together with just our cat, so no kids. She's currently doing a PhD that has required her to go to America to a major city for 6 months. It was really lonely but I managed to get through it waiting for her to come back. While she was there I just sort of existed and worked. I don't really have any friends because we've always relied on each other a bit too much.
So while she was over there, in about month 5, she told me pretty much that being over there and the friends she made helped her realise that I didn't make her feel truly cared for or seen or understood. I've always loved her and wanted a family with her but have been a bit of a typical guy in being able to make myself vulnerable and express things well.
So anyway, we agreed to try too have a go at things and make changes, and she came home a week ago. Yesterday she told me her decision to end things. She wants a life I can't give her and wants the freedom to travel for the career she wants, so for her every arrow points at us breaking up.
This has been my life for the last 11 years. I don't have any friends, and I've seen how cripplingly lonely life can be without anyone to connect to. We're still in the house together, and I still want to be with her and be close with her. But it's crushing at the same time.

I&amp;#39;ve been with my girlfriend for 11 years, and for all intents and purposes we&amp;#39;ve pretty much been married. We live together with just our cat, so no kids. She&amp;#39;s currently doing a PhD that has required her to go to America to a major city for 6 months. It was really lonely but I managed to get through it waiting for her to come back. While she was there I just sort of existed and worked. I don&amp;#39;t really have any friends because we&amp;#39;ve always relied on each other a bit too much.
So while she was over there, in about month 5, she told me pretty much that being over there and the friends she made helped her realise that I didn&amp;#39;t make her feel truly cared for or seen or understood. I&amp;#39;ve always loved her and wanted a family with her but have been a bit of a typical guy in being able to make myself vulnerable and express things well.
So anyway, we agreed to try too have a go at things and make changes, and she came home a week ago. Yesterday she told me her decision to end things. She wants a life I can&amp;#39;t give her and wants the freedom to travel for the career she wants, so for her every arrow points at us breaking up.
This has been my life for the last 11 years. I don&amp;#39;t have any friends, and I&amp;#39;ve seen how cripplingly lonely life can be without anyone to connect to. We&amp;#39;re still in the house together, and I still want to be with her and be close with her. But it&amp;#39;s crushing at the same time. I&amp;#39;m also trying to think of what steps I need to take and I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do.

You created a narrative where I wasn’t willing to try. Yet, you never asked.

You chose to tell me I was wrong when I said I wanted to go.

You created this idea that I would be too uncomfortable with your lifestyle. I agree that going out multiple times a week to disappear into large crowds of music fans isn’t my favorite activity, but you decided that I couldn’t handle it without asking.

You claim that we have nothing together and decided to forget about the wonderful times we had over the course of our relationship. You didn’t want to think of the pool parties, outings with friends, the date nights, curling up in bed listening to soft music while we talked all night, the times I joined you to enjoy your favorite DJs, the times we danced, our late night karaoke fests and how warm we felt when cuddling up next to each other for a movie. You chose that those things didn’t matter.

You chose that your happiness was worth more than finding peace with me. You chose that you didn't want to ask about my happiness. What could we find together to fulfill both of our needs. You chose that your happiness was worth more than our life together. More than the love we had for each other. 

When I asked for counseling or a separation, you chose to say no. You said that no matter what, this path would lead to divorce and that it wouldn’t matter in the end. You chose to end our relationship and the potential path to either rediscovering our spark or at the very worst, finding a path to friendship after spending our entire lives together.

You chose to say the words, I want a divorce, and then followed up with anger when I found a new place to live. If you wanted to have an argument about the divorce, you should have started one. You should have never let me walk away.

You chose to file paperwork with a lawyer, despite my desperate attempts to ask you to wait and stay and try.

You chose to cut me out of your life on a random Tuesday afternoon so that you could chase a life of partying. A life that I never once said no to. 

You selfishly took away my life; my home, my sense of safety, my sense of belonging, my trust in the person I have loved more than anyone else in this world. You walked away and I am lost. I don’t know where to turn. I don’t know how to move forward. I don’t know how to stop loving you, because you have been my number one priority my entire life.

,Divorce,"I’ve [26 F] seen it coming for a while now, my parents have lived like glorified roommates for as long as I can remember. But now I’m worried about what’s going to come next. It will not be an amicable divorce since my father was blindsided by this and I’m going to need some advice. 

Let me start of by saying it’s been really obvious my mom hasn’t been happy for a long time and I’m absolutely shocked that my dad has zero clue it was coming. I was expecting to sit down as a family [1 sibling, brother, 23] and have them break the news but my father called us each and told us that it was happening. He also made a few exaggerations along with it but that’s a whole other story. My mom somehow found out about this phone call and got extremely upset and sobbing, letting me know she was heading out to stay with a friend, and mentioned searching for an apartment. 

My worries lie with their finances. My dad was the sole provider and as far as I’m concerned was responsible for paying all of the mortgage and other bills. He’s said he’s never asked my mother for a dime. They’ve made a lot of avoidable financial mistakes in the past- my dad never got a 401k and banked on the house as being his retirement. My mom is a hairstylist but only has enough clients to work part time, about 3-4 days a week and I’m going to say she probably makes a little under $25,000 a year with a small savings. My dad lost his job over a year ago and drained some of his savings but recently got a new job making about the same amount of money. They’ve had separate bank accounts their entire marriage and never shared any finances as far as I know. 

Right now my main concern is my mom. She made a comment that she was really worried about her finances and that she may only be able to afford a studio apartment. She doesn’t have a degree, only a high school education, and she rents out a studio space to cut hair which means little growth for her client list. My father has been providing for her for their entire marriage and I’m going to be so heartbroken to see her struggle. Im a little resentful since she’s been thinking about leaving my dad for a while now, why she hasn’t thought about lining up a second job or working somewhere with benefits and a more sustainable salary to afford to live on her own means. 

What advice can I give her when she’s ready to hear it? I don’t have the means to support my mother and feel selfish for already thinking about how she can absolutely stay at my house with my boyfriend and I when she needs to but not as a long term (or even short term) option.

,Divorce,"*Backstory:* I was once a very successful man with a beautiful wife and a $850,000 house on the outskirts of Malibu, CA... but in the span of 6 years my step father was ran over and killed, my father committed suicide, my youngest brother committed suicide, 18 days later my best friend over dosed, 9 months later my uncle was found dead in his apartment, and now my wife is divorcing me. I have been diagnosed with major depression disorder, panic disorder, PTSD, and I'm going through the process of filing for permanent disability because I haven't been able to work in almost 3 years.

My wife and I have been together over 11 years but we have lived separately for a little over a year and a half. She 'served' me with separation paperwork 6 months ago but she claims she never turned it in after I signed it... she also can't say the D word (divorce) and although it's assumed - she hasn't actually filed for a divorce. She doesn't go longer than 2 or 3 days without texting me (mostly because we have a 5 year old son together and lately the texts have all pertained to him). We haven't talked about ""us"" in over 6 months.

,Divorce,"Hi everyone! 
I’m a 29 year old trans woman MtF post op living in stealth mode (people don’t know I’m trans). I have been officially divorced from my 30 year old ex husband for 6 weeks. We have been separated for 3.5 months. I’m posting this to vent because I believe it will be therapeutic.  This is a long story. **Tl:dr at bottom**

So I have been a lurker here for a while but I have officially lost my nerve and I just really need to vent. I can handle anything but divorce has really fucked me hard. I have a new sympathy for people who are divorced against their will. It’s the worst pain imaginable. People  think I’m a happy social extrovert based off my personality, but I’m actually a loner by choice in my private life. I do not prefer much social interaction outside of my job due to discrimination/abuse from pretty much every angle of society for being trans since I was a child so now that I go through this divorce, I realize I need support. So here I am. I officially I transitioned when I was 19. I pass very well and have been able to lead a successful normal life, but I was abandoned and disowned by my family (I do keep secret communication with my mom though and she has been a big support through this) and none of my close best friends (who I do talk to about this for support) currently live nearby so here goes:

I was with my ex husband for 2 years, and I can honestly say if you take out the arguing about him getting a job, they were a dream come true and the best 2 years of my life that I wouldn’t trade for the world. I didn’t feel alone and I felt so much joy being a wife, lover and best friend. He accepted me fully (or so I thought) and I felt so beautiful to him. He made love to my entire body like no one ever had, we went on adventures, and we had a lot of gamer/nerdy things in common. People would see us together and I could tell they thought we were relationship goals. It was really great. It all turned to shit when he wasn’t willing to get a stable income job and while I was supportive of him trying different things, I always made it clear he needed to get a job so that I wouldn’t feel resentful for paying for everything. 

He said he would easily get a stable income job if his other ventures didn’t pan out and I was SO deeply in love so I believed him and married him anyways since I was making a ton of money at my job. I had been broke and homeless multiple times in my life when I was younger so to become a high income earner in spite of being trans (it usually doesn’t happen for girls like me), I was just so grateful for my deck of cards life had given me at that point that I completely overlooked how much I would end up resenting him for not financially contributing. Material possessions never meant much to me, and since I had so much money I didn’t know what to do with, I shared it willingly with him while I gave him a chance to try to find his niche. He had a couple of things he was doing but none of them panned out and my patience ended after 1.5 years of him trying them. 

He always reassured me that he could acquire a job easily through his parents or step parents who both worked in great companies and could easily help him attain a good job if he needed to as a backup. I know what you’re thinking. I should have waited to marry him until he had a stable income job, but he was so believable and I loved him so much so I just went with it (not my brightest moment). And honestly I would have given zero fucks about what type of job it was I would have been happy with anything even if it was him flipping burgers because it would have showed he was making effort!

Ultimately, after our annual family reunion (his side not mine) and many arguments in the last 3 months of our marriage that stemmed from his lack of employment, he said he wanted out. We argued a lot because I became too bitter and resentful for him not working or making meaningful effort to find a job after his niche efforts failed. My resentfulness came out like poison in little ways and I realize looking back now that I got upset at little things that normally would never bug me. He hated the concept of earning money, and he couldn’t have put more than 3 job applications in while we were together in 2 years. If I asked him did he put in any applications that day, his entire demeanor would change and our night was ruined. 

He ultimately wanted to separate and left me and while we were sleeping in separate bedrooms, he knew I was talking to his family at that point about the situation and he left me for good. They reassured me it wasn’t my fault and they had trouble making him get a job his whole life. When my ex found out I spoke to his family, he felt I was talking shit about him and making him look bad, but I told him that wasn’t the case. I was simply desperate and was hoping they could get through to him about the job thing so that I wouldn’t have to be the one to bring it up and we could stop arguing about it. By that point he began texting a girl he had dated from his past and I saw the messages on his birthday saying how much he hated me, how much he never forgot her, and being married to me was the worst decision ever since all I wanted him to do was “get a big boy job”. I couldn’t forgive him for reaching out to his ex, and he was not willing to go to marriage counseling so we split for good. 

**This is where the biggest trauma begins:**

Upon leaving, he said some pretty hurtful things that I never needed to hear regardless if they were true or not. They echo in mind over and over to this day and I’m scarred. Keep in mind, I’ve never degraded him, I financially took care of him, and I always tried to lift him up because I wanted our marriage to WORK. He said/texted:
“Trans women were never my sexual preference to real women.”
“You’re never going to be a real woman. You’re always going to be something halfway between a man and a woman and the sooner you accept that, the sooner you will be happy”
“Here take the wedding ring back I always felt like a faggot wearing it anyways”
“Stop using me to validate your identity as a woman”
“I loved you but love wasn’t why I married you. I married you for financial reasons”

Til this day, he has never sincerely apologized to me for the hurtful things he said and done aside from the half assed words “p.s. sorry for some stuff I said” tied into a text that was about the specifics of separating our stuff. I don’t think he will ever accept or acknowledge how emotionally/financially abusive he was.

He then outed me to his entire family without my consent to make it seem like that’s why he was leaving me. I know he also did this so they would separate from me too because he knew that even though they loved me tons, they are still conservative. Also, he didn’t want them to see it as our divorce was caused by him being lazy for not getting a job.

We separated 3.5 months ago, and he immediately started hooking up with women on tinder. He impregnated one only two weeks after our separation and is currently living with his parents. He wants nothing to do with me, and so I signed the divorce papers. Our divorce was finalized only a month and a half ago.

**NOW:**

So after going through the most traumatic breakup of my life, I have officially come out with PTSD. It’s gotten horrific, and I am struggling to deal with the emotional abuse and manipulation this man put me through at the end as well as how to stop missing the good man I thought I married. I wake up almost every night sweating because he is in my dreams. In every dream it’s either one where we reunited and he is holding me and telling me how much he loves me OR it’s one where he has left me and I can see him with the pregnant woman he knocked up. 

I have never felt attached to a man in my life. Not to sound immodest but I’m regarded as highly attractive and it has never been hard for me to get dates, but as soon as I tell men I’m trans post op, they immediately hypersexualize me and become vulgar wanting sex asap. There were a couple guys that were attractive, nice and accepted me but I didn’t feel any chemistry compared to what I had with my ex so I broke it off. Dating is a pain up my ass.... 

My ex was the first man that I was attracted to that I felt I could be completely vulnerable with in every way. He respected me tons in the beginning. He made me feel like superwoman and I loved that he saw past the fact that I was trans and that there was so much more to me than this one fucking detail that I hate my life being defined by. And then to find out it was all manipulation? In my heart I want to believe so badly that our relationship wasn’t just a boy manipulating a rich girl with an insecurity so that he could use her for money. But ultimately that is what happened. I want to believe at least some of it was real.... Fuck.

And that he hated the fact that I was trans all along? And that he used my being trans as his reason for leaving me when he outed me to his family without my consent? It has honestly fucking destroyed me. I feel so betrayed on so many levels that he outed me to make me look bad to his family to potentially get them to cut themselves off from me (when he knows I was abandoned my own family), and to use that as a reason for leaving me has cut me so hard. This betrayal has cut so deep I honestly am scarred worse than ever before. More so than my family disowning me. More so than anything I have ever been through. 

I can remember the texts we exchanged in the end and how angry he was and cruel and it’s just hard to understand how someone who loved you SO much and was SO obssessed with you could completely turn their back on you? I mean anywhere I went this man couldn’t keep me out of his sight. And also, how the fuck could he fall in love so fast according to him with this new girl who he got pregnant? The last text I got from him a couple weeks ago is that he loves her, plans to marry her, and can no longer talk to me out of respect for his new relationship. So it’s completely dead for him, and I just have to accept SO MUCH in such a short period of time and it all just hurts like a motherfucker. 

I think the other part of my trauma is just learning to accept it’s over forever and I still don’t want to. When we initially separated I believed our love was powerful, cosmic, and divine and it would bring us together again. A small part of me still does. But now there is a woman he barely knew off tinder that he is about to have a baby with? I feel like this pregnancy has shot that 1% chance of getting back together straight to hell. And knowing he finally got a job after we split but couldn’t fucking do it when we were together? I have so much anger now.

I know what you’re thinking reading this. Oh girl you deserve so much better he was such a lazy asshole. I agree. I have been more successful than ever and aside from him ripping my heart out of my chest, everything else is pretty great in my life. But I’m still in love with him. I still love the fuck out of him. I’m struggling to let him go and to stop hating him at the same time. I hate him so much for being such a manipulative person who hit below the belt at the end to try to hurt my self esteem. I don’t know how to let go of the loving and kind gentle man he was before he left me and it all turned to shit. I constantly tell myself that he was just a manipulative gold digger and it just an act, but I guess a part of me doesn’t want to let that good part of him go because it’s the first time I ever was emotionally drawn to a man in my life that I could be fully vulnerable with. And the good times were so fucking good I can literally taste them. Anyways.... that’s my story. Typing that all out helped a lot. Thanks for reading xo

,Divorce,"I recently started seeing a therapist, solo, in an attempt to ensure I'm coming from a place of clarity before I spring the discussion on my dear husband who probably doesn't know just how much I've been struggling with the idea of staying in our marriage.  He might not know anything at all beyond the fact that I seem depressed.

Also in the name of clarity, I gave up alcohol in early August and cannabis in early September.  Both of those changes have gone fairly well, because even though I've had a few moments of longing for the mental escapes that I had previously been embracing overly much, I wanted the clarity even more... for internal reasons, as well as for preparing everyone external to me for something that I don't want to seem like it came out of nowhere.

I'm also trying to convince myself to get sufficient sleep, and although I've made some progress, I'm still not consistent and thus I know I'm still not in my best frame of mind.  But I'm getting closer.  Everything is getting closer.

Background:  I'm 40F married to a 43M for 12 years, living together for 18 years, 15 of that in a house that is in both our names.  We have a 7yo son, and when he was about 3 we started TTC (unsuccessfully, thank goodness) for a few years before I told him I absolutely didn't want any more (mostly because I was starting to doubt our marriage, but he didn't know that).  I originally went into the relationship thinking he would be a good choice to be a ""happily ever after"" person because we got along fine, but I've realized I'm kinda getting sick of the stuff I was doing to pretend to be the perfect wife for him:

* trying to mesh my scientific background into the things he has as his hobbies -- but I think my PhD PTSD has killed that side of me, so I don't even like talking science anymore... but maybe only with him?  I do still talk a lot of math and science with my kid, so maybe I'm not totally dead in this respect.   I suppose this is probably a side-effect of the distance I've been feeling with him... and this is also related to me giving up beer, since he is a homebrewer and was his favourite taste-tester, and it was puzzling me for years why I wasn't getting into the sciencey side of things with him.  Surely I *should* be interested, since I liked both beer and science!  It was like I didn't *want* to connect with him.
* learning to be a good housewife -- but I tell myself this was for me, as I've always wanted to learn to cook and to keep a house in good order and I love the idea of knowing where everything is without having to search, but I'm flailing so horribly in the latter that I feel like I'm a failure as a human being (which is one thing I'm hoping I'll fix with therapy).
* ""putting out"" often enough that he was satisfied -- I thought perhaps I simply have a low libido, so I tried to ""fake it till I make it"" since more sex tended to make sex feel easier for me, but maybe I was wrong in thinking that I could just choose to love someone without being attracted to them physically... but, worse, I've started to find myself being physically attracted to other people, but he has no interest whatsoever in any kind of open relationship or threesomes even though we had been joking (or half-joking, in my case) for years about getting a girlfriend;
* and, overall, being the cool chick that I always thought he needed as his girl after his ex-girlfriend left him for another guy (and I was the rebound relationship, after we were friends for 6-7 years, met in highschool, shared a house together with the aforementioned girlfriend and my then-boyfriend).  I realize now I was defining myself by trying to live up to this thought of being the perfect girl for him since he was such a cool guy... and I have recently started grieving who I might've become without him.  I was just a baby back then, merely 21 when we got started, and very uncertain about who I wanted to be when I grew up!  I still doesn't know. :(

In my first therapy session, my purpose was not to reveal my main struggle, because I wanted to take some time after meeting with her to ponder whether she was a good fit for me.  We talked a lot about how I feel stuck in so many things I'm trying to do, in particular what to do with my life outside of being a housewife, and also how to succeed in the homemaking side of things, specifically in trying to get my house in order.  So it was still big stuff that is weighing heavily on me, but not the biggest stuff.

I'm not even sure if there's anything I expect she can do about the biggest stuff.  My main reason to be in therapy is to make sure I've ""tried everything"" before I start talking to my husband about how bad I feel our relationship has become.   Yes, I know, talking with one's spouse would ideally be the first thing a person would do when having such troubles, but our relationship has never really been the talking type.  Anytime he and I ever did talk about anything I was struggling with, I always felt like a child who was being patted on the head and reassured that everything would be fine eventually, and that if I come up with anything that he can do to help I should let him know.  Cue his bright-but-fake smile, and me faking a smile too while wiping my tears, and that's the end of that.  I don't know emotions either, having only recently realized I actually have them and can't simply reason them away, so I definitely don't blame him for not understanding!  But I did gradually get to the point where I didn't ever want to talk to him about important stuff like this anymore because I never felt any better from it.  So, yeah, we have communication problems, but to me it feels like just one of many ways we don't connect.

Anyways, today was my second therapy session, and for most of the hour it went about the same as last time, but with different angles on the same struggles... with the addition of me puzzling over how to bring the conversation over to where I was determined to go with it today.  But I was scared to say it, because dammit, this is a huge deal.

Eventually, I noticed our time was close to running out, and I really didn’t want to avoid saying something for any longer, definitely not to wait for next session.  I steeled myself for one last attempt to reveal the main reason I was there.  I started fumbling for words.  ""Maybe...""  I kept pushing myself because I knew I had to get it out.  ""Maybe,"" I said, ""maybe all of this is echoing something else ... something that is affecting everything... which is... my ... my ... doubt about my relationship.""  That's as much as I could muster about it.

I had tears streaming down my face.  I couldn’t speak anymore, but my therapist was talking, basically congratulating me for finding the nerve to say that, since she could tell how hard it was for me to say.  She thanked me for feeling comfortable enough to say it.  She also said it makes a lot of things from last session make more sense, which is exactly what I expected, except the part about her saying it out loud.  I think a lot of today’s conversation will make more sense to her in hindsight too, because I definitely tried to leave a lot of hints that I wanted to talk about my husband.  I ended up thanking her too, and was grateful when she suggested we set up an appointment for next week instead of farther in the future.

I'm still a little shaky, but also feeling very pleased with myself for bringing myself to say something.  Self-hug!  I'm not entirely sure where I'm going to go next with the discussion... perhaps I'm just looking for more validation that I'm allowed to feel my feelings and get more comfortable with making my own decisions about what to do next.

Is there anyone else out there who has been preparing for discussing things in therapy and is trying to come up with ways to say it?  Or is there anyone who has some good stories about the start of their separation discussion with a therapist?

He might not know anything at all beyond the fact that I seem depressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in the name of clarity, I gave up alcohol in early August and cannabis in early September.  Both of those changes have gone fairly well, because even though I&amp;#39;ve had a few moments of longing for the mental escapes that I had previously been embracing overly much, I wanted the clarity even more... for internal reasons, as well as for preparing everyone external to me for something that I don&amp;#39;t want to seem like it came out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also trying to convince myself to get sufficient sleep, and although I&amp;#39;ve made some progress, I&amp;#39;m still not consistent and thus I know I&amp;#39;m still not in my best frame of mind.  But I&amp;#39;m getting closer.  Everything is getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background:  I&amp;#39;m 40F married to a 43M for 12 years, living together for 18 years, 15 of that in a house that is in both our names.  We have a 7yo son, and when he was about 3 we started TTC (unsuccessfully, thank goodness) for a few years before I told him I absolutely didn&amp;#39;t want any more (mostly because I was starting to doubt our marriage, but he didn&amp;#39;t know that).

,Divorce,"Hi all. Having a rough day. 

STBXH and I are still cohabiting due to the kids &amp; our money situation. It’s been going decent so far. 

The reason for our divorce is solely because X has anger issues and does not respectively or effectively communicate. He chooses anger. 

We split a month ago. I told him I don’t care if he sees other people - he said he isn’t looking for a companion, just occasional sex. Last night, he left at 11. He didn’t get home until 7am when I was about to take our toddler to preschool. He said him and the girl talked all night. 

Why can he communicate with someone else? Why can he ask about their dreams and goals?

I asked last year if, at the end of the day, we can unplug and ask each other how our day was. I asked consistently for a week. He never asked me. 

I defended him to all of our family and friends. I have been so nice, understanding, and helpful. Overall just friendly and forgiving our entire marriage, while begging him to go on meds or seek counseling for his anger and depression. 

So it feels like a slap in the face that he can be nice and sweet and talkative with a girl he just met. This girl is getting a part of him I begged for for years. My heart hurts.

,Divorce," APs last post = '37m\_in\_loveless\_marriage\_and\_now\_deeply\_in\_love'  (can't link it sorry! *note that this was only a few weeks ago and he was still struggling to decide if he could handle the logistics of separation vs. the unhappiness of his marriage*)    
**WHO DO YOU CHOOSE? YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH!:** A couple of months ago, AP/MM and I decided to be together (after a long romance), with an agreement to check back in after three months and call it quits if nothing concrete had happened by then.  


That three month check-in is now only a few weeks away, and I've started viewing it anxiously as (for the first time) we are NOT on the same page.   
**A UNIQUE SUFFERING:** In general I would describe myself as an optimist that sets goals and achieves them practically and efficiently. A lot of my agony in this situation is that I'm stuck waiting around for someone else to make decisions about my own life, and that person is the self-confessed 'least decisive man who's ever lived'. AND that man has decided to hospital-pass the decision making to his wife. AND he's admitted that his wife won't leave him. So when looked at logically, it appears that there's no glimmer of hope on the horizon. This appears to be the reality of the situation, but when I put it to him in those terms he angrily disagrees and instead says that he's directing things but just letting stuff come up more 'naturally'.   
My growing fear is that I have been cherry-picking out any bit of optimism I can find and calling it hope, but all in the absence of a single actual promise or piece of real evidence. In my entire adult life I have never felt as terrible as I feel right now. My self-worth has plummeted to a new low, and i've been physically sick from the stress and anxiety. My work is suffering, i'm more withdrawn in my social circle, i've lost the drive to do the things i'd normally enjoy recreationally, and i'm letting things pile up more and more from a general depression related avoidance of tasks.   
Socially, I'm degraded and humiliated, a laughing stock that's being openly mocked for my foolish naivety (the idea being that I've fallen for the same bullshit lies that every married man tells his piece on the side). I'm in tears most days mostly over the looming feeling that I'm ignoring all logical judgement and making a gigantic mistakes because i'm too ashamed/naive to admit the reality/truth of what's actually happening.   
In the meantime I have no shortage of eager and eligible suitors, which you'd think make me feel better but really it just amplifies the pain of having decided who I really want, and stuck waiting to see if he'll have me too.   
This man I want is telling me daily over and over that he wants me and is trying to ""find the path"" to make that happen, but is actively not taking the first steps on the path to separation. I 100% believe that he does want me, but I don't know if he wants me enough to have me if it means too much 'life admin' for him in the short term. The issue is that he says he IS taking those steps and I'm just not seeing them.   
**SOME BACKGROUND CONTEXT - MY OWN SPLIT:**  I was also in an unhappy long term relationship when AP/MM and I met. After years being unhappy and trying/waiting for things to change, i eventually decided to end the relationship earlier this year. I did so in around 5-weeks from having first telling my ex that I had decided to separate (agreeing to a short trial separation, then making an official split). I had my own temptations to stall (parents in hospital, legal battle with work, holidays planned and paid for, family events we'd committed to together) but ultimately I decided that waiting for a 'convenient time' is a pathetic excuse for dragging out an inevitable (including selfishly robbing him of time he could be investing in his future).  
I'd been convinced that it would be an utter traumatic disaster, but it ended up being very mature, respectful, and civil.   
It wasn't the easy choice, but I felt it was the right choice, and that's generally how I've always tried to live my life *(don't even ask me how I ended up tangled up in this current mess with a married man... it wasn't what either of us wanted or what was looking for... but we could not ignore our genuine love for each other and desire to try and make it something real).*   
**INDEFINITELY LONG HOLDING PATTERN AND RUNNING LOW ON FUEL:**   
Everyone I know who has separated (including myself, and the vast majority of redditors who've shared their experiences online) all made the firm decision to leave as step 1, then did what needed to be done to make it it happen as step 2.  
How long the decision to leave took varied wildly, but actually leaving was always fairly swift (short term suffering to avoid delaying the inevitable, and start rebuilding things as early as possible). The only exceptions to this were people who 'stayed for the kids' (all who regretted having done so later).   
In the past two months, AP/MM believes he's leap ahead in giant strides, whereas I see nothing but inching forward and stalling. He says his mind is made up and he's making it happen as 'fast as seems reasonably possible', but there appears to be no real evidence in his actions to back that up? He's clearly said many times that he can't and won't promise me any timeline other than it ""most likely"" wouldn't be more than another 7-months (so 9-months from having first discussed things) til he'd started something. He also says it could be much earlier (with the speed and force that conflict has escalated), but won't deny that he'd try any decision by her to leave until the overseas parent visiting has departed (early Feb 2020).   
**HIS VIEW - LEAPS AND BOUNDS:**  
1. He's made certain in his mind that he does not love her, that the marriage is not repairable, and that he will leave (decisions he'd be wrestling with for years before he met me).   
2. He's mentally worked through and accepted the consequences of separation (e.g. feeling like a failure, being embarrassed about divorce, finances, custody) and discussed it with a psychologist over two sessions (and with me for hundreds of hours :S).   
3. He's started letting the marital relationship deteriorate by not smoothing things over, not avoiding conflict/fights when they come up, and not providing false assurances. He's also stopped saying I love you. She asked him twice lately if he was going to leave her and each time he said ""this is not the time to talk about that"". When she's asked ""do you love me?"" he's not replied.   
4. He decided he ideally doesn't want to bring up any mention of separation until after Feb 2020. This is so her and their son are available when his parents each visit from overseas for a month (Nov and Jan). This is so his parents have unrestricted access to their grandson while here (their only grandchild, and potentially their last visit to see him due to their age/health).   
5. He feels like this deterioration is ramping up significantly with more frequent flare ups, and bigger fights than ever before. He also admits that this would all be prepping where he wouldn't plan on actually physically leaving until after Feb 2020 (when his mother flies back overseas after visiting their child).   
6. He believes that the tension of Christmas and his mum visiting in January (times he and his wife have historically fought the most) would feel like the ""most natural"" time for them to have a more mutual separation (versus introducing it earlier which he says would utterly ""blindside her"" and cause ""unbearable chaos, scar tissue, and brutal trauma"" to his wife, their son, and each of his parents. It's not clear if he genuinely thinks stalling another half year will make the difficulty and tension of divorce that make less than doing something this year, or if it's just the easy path in terms of not having to shuffle things around when his parents visit (housing, access to their grandchild, xmas day, etc).   
7. He admits that without any time pressure from me he'd wait at least another year before bringing anything up with her about separating (potentially far longer). His plan/goal being that he slowly 'ghosts out' until SHE decides they should separate, but the problem being that he knows she's happy to continue with things as they are indefinitely. This is an almost exact copy of his fathers unhappy relationship with his mother that he fully acknowledges. He would rather continue with things as they are for many years versus losing face and being seen as the 'bad guy' for leaving. I suspected this desire to delay was a hope that things might improve/reconcile in the future, but he passionately denies that (saying he spent years trying and failing to fix the marriage before settling into the grim flatmate daycare nothingness that he describes now).   
So this brings me to my view   
**MY VIEW:**     
1. His desire/decision/plan to stay together with her (for all of October, November, December, January, and February) for the sake of not having to rearrange things during his mum visiting and to ""avoid blindsiding her"" is a completely inadequate reason. It appears to value avoiding some distant future inconvenience over losing me.    
2. His hope/expectation that i'll contently sit on the sidelines (without any actual promise or evidence that my investment into 'us' is leading to anything real) seems completely deranged. I've said from the beginning that I won't sit around waiting indefinitely. To add to this, he refuses to give any actual promises other than he's ""doing his best"" and ""inching towards things"". This is straying into Carrie Fisher in When Harry Met Sally territory, the same words that thousands of women have mistaken for promises and hope in the absence of any real evidence. He appears to have no comprehension or care re: the emotional impact that would have on me (or anyone in that situation) which indicates a worrying lack of empathy, love, and insight.  
3. He truly believes that doing something in the short term (e.g. actually telling her he's unhappy with the marriage, or moving into spare room) would ""brutally traumatise"" his parents, his son, and lead to a resentful hatred from his wife. He also believes that if he waits 5 months before saying/doing something, then that will be avoided. This doesn't seem based in reality to me, and doesn't address that things will still be just as hard in 5 months (potentially ever moving goal posts). Is this a man whose simply not ready to leave? Or the signs of a cowardly and selfish man that'd hurt people around him for the sake of saving face (e.g. not being the bad guy?).   
4. Each 'action' step taken so far (talking to a counselor, making a pros/cons list, working through his fears, deciding where he'd live and the budget, researching custody arrangements) has been fairly pressured by me, as in all things he says he wouldn't have done without me asking. The two concrete things he'd agreed to do at home have both been reneged. He had agreed to (sometime in the following couple of months) to have a conversation with her about being unhappy and to suggest him sleeping in the spare room for a while (my suggestions), then when brought up again he instead listed reasons why that wasn't actually possible in the next couple of months (that it would ""risk losing his son"" and ""screw up o much with the whole family""), and even a suggestion that i'd been mistaken that he'd even agreed to that in the first place.   
5. Being honest with myself, waiting around as a secret on the side for another five (or who really knows how many) months would breed resentment and anger in me. I already increasingly feel like i'm just an option, not a priority. He says that losing me would be the greatest regret of his life, yet I feel like while he's saying that, he's actively pouncing on opportunities where us splitting up would be my choice (indicating that he wouldn't even really care?). I'm worried that this is him doing the bare minimum to keep me from leaving so as to disrupt his routine as little as possible. I've brought this up and the reaction was his feelings being hurt at the suggestion he doesn't care, but zero reassurances provided to be other than that he loves me.   
6. He admits that many of his major life decisions have been made through convenience and conflict avoidance (path of least resistance). In this sense, I am able to guide things by applying reasonable pressure and support. This leaves me torn between doing what I think is right for everyone (separating whether or not it's to be with me, and doing it earlier rather than later so she's got the holiday period to sort things out for her and the son + not using her in a fake marriage just for the convenience factor   


7. What's left out here is the day-to-day love, fun, respect and affection in our relationship. This will read like a foolish girl being tricked by another bullshitting man having his cake and eating it to, where-as we are each other's best friend and life together is pretty perfect except for the fact that he's got to rush home to another woman each evening. 

  
**EXTRA CONSIDERATIONS**   
1. She most likely thinks he's just going through a grumpy patch. Fighting is normal for them, so she may not have even noticed that it's intensified lately. Ultimately, they are by and large living married life no different to any other year including no change in their daily routine (dinner together each day, sleeping in same bed each night, raising their son together as normal).   
2. She will most likely be more vigilant during this deterioration, presumably drastically reducing the time he's able to spend with me.   
3. I am absolutely opposed to the idea of 'waiting on the sidelines' for another 4-6+ months. I've said many times that I have no intention of sitting around alone wondering what's happening over xmas/new year. His counter argument is to simply say that he'll hate every second of those holidays with her, but then no explanation why that's the choice he's leaning towards.   
4. He's putting her in charge of directing the timeline and conversations of the split (hopeful that it'll deteriorate 'naturally' over time (once he stops providing input in terms of smoothing over conflicts and tensions), but at the same time acknowledges that he's certain she's perfectly happy to continue indefinitely the way things are. 

**TL;DR** 

MM/AP said he will separate to be with me, but saying he needs at least 6-months before anything concrete will start to happen (to have full custody when his parents visit in Nov and Jan, and to make the separation feel more mutual by letting the marriage deteriorate over xmas). Asking me to wait for him, but refuses to promise me anything. He thinks i'm being unreasonably impatient and trying to rush things, and I think he's dragging out the inevitable for the sake of cowardice and selfish personal convenience.

I&amp;#39;d been convinced that it would be an utter traumatic disaster, but it ended up being very mature, respectful, and civil.&lt;br/&gt;
It wasn&amp;#39;t the easy choice, but I felt it was the right choice, and that&amp;#39;s generally how I&amp;#39;ve always tried to live my life &lt;em&gt;(don&amp;#39;t even ask me how I ended up tangled up in this current mess with a married man... it wasn&amp;#39;t what either of us wanted or what was looking for... but we could not ignore our genuine love for each other and desire to try and make it something real).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;INDEFINITELY LONG HOLDING PATTERN AND RUNNING LOW ON FUEL:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Everyone I know who has separated (including myself, and the vast majority of redditors who&amp;#39;ve shared their experiences online) all made the firm decision to leave as step 1, then did what needed to be done to make it it happen as step 2.&lt;br/&gt;
How long the decision to leave took varied wildly, but actually leaving was always fairly swift (short term suffering to avoid delaying the inevitable, and start rebuilding things as early as possible). The only exceptions to this were people who &amp;#39;stayed for the kids&amp;#39; (all who regretted having done so later).&lt;br/&gt;
In the past two months, AP/MM believes he&amp;#39;s leap ahead in giant strides, whereas I see nothing but inching forward and stalling. He says his mind is made up and he&amp;#39;s making it happen as &amp;#39;fast as seems reasonably possible&amp;#39;, but there appears to be no real evidence in his actions to back that up? He&amp;#39;s clearly said many times that he can&amp;#39;t and won&amp;#39;t promise me any timeline other than it &amp;quot;most likely&amp;quot; wouldn&amp;#39;t be more than another 7-months (so 9-months from having first discussed things) til he&amp;#39;d started something. He also says it could be much earlier (with the speed and force that conflict has escalated), but won&amp;#39;t deny that he&amp;#39;d try any decision by her to leave until the overseas parent visiting has departed (early Feb 2020).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;HIS VIEW - LEAPS AND BOUNDS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
1. He&amp;#39;s made certain in his mind that he does not love her, that the marriage is not repairable, and that he will leave (decisions he&amp;#39;d be wrestling with for years before he met me).&lt;br/&gt;
2. He&amp;#39;s mentally worked through and accepted the consequences of separation (e.g. feeling like a failure, being embarrassed about divorce, finances, custody) and discussed it with a psychologist over two sessions (and with me for hundreds of hours :S).&lt;br/&gt;
3. He&amp;#39;s started letting the marital relationship deteriorate by not smoothing things over, not avoiding conflict/fights when they come up, and not providing false assurances. He&amp;#39;s also stopped saying I love you. She asked him twice lately if he was going to leave her and each time he said &amp;quot;this is not the time to talk about that&amp;quot;. When she&amp;#39;s asked &amp;quot;do you love me?&amp;quot; he&amp;#39;s not replied.&lt;br/&gt;
4. He decided he ideally doesn&amp;#39;t want to bring up any mention of separation until after Feb 2020. This is so her and their son are available when his parents each visit from overseas for a month (Nov and Jan). This is so his parents have unrestricted access to their grandson while here (their only grandchild, and potentially their last visit to see him due to their age/health).&lt;br/&gt;
5. He feels like this deterioration is ramping up significantly with more frequent flare ups, and bigger fights than ever before. He also admits that this would all be prepping where he wouldn&amp;#39;t plan on actually physically leaving until after Feb 2020 (when his mother flies back overseas after visiting their child).&lt;br/&gt;
6. He believes that the tension of Christmas and his mum visiting in January (times he and his wife have historically fought the most) would feel like the &amp;quot;most natural&amp;quot; time for them to have a more mutual separation (versus introducing it earlier which he says would utterly &amp;quot;blindside her&amp;quot; and cause &amp;quot;unbearable chaos, scar tissue, and brutal trauma&amp;quot; to his wife, their son, and each of his parents. It&amp;#39;s not clear if he genuinely thinks stalling another half year will make the difficulty and tension of divorce that make less than doing something this year, or if it&amp;#39;s just the easy path in terms of not having to shuffle things around when his parents visit (housing, access to their grandchild, xmas day, etc).&lt;br/&gt;
7. He admits that without any time pressure from me he&amp;#39;d wait at least another year before bringing anything up with her about separating (potentially far longer). His plan/goal being that he slowly &amp;#39;ghosts out&amp;#39; until SHE decides they should separate, but the problem being that he knows she&amp;#39;s happy to continue with things as they are indefinitely. This is an almost exact copy of his fathers unhappy relationship with his mother that he fully acknowledges. He would rather continue with things as they are for many years versus losing face and being seen as the &amp;#39;bad guy&amp;#39; for leaving. I suspected this desire to delay was a hope that things might improve/reconcile in the future, but he passionately denies that (saying he spent years trying and failing to fix the marriage before settling into the grim flatmate daycare nothingness that he describes now).&lt;br/&gt;
So this brings me to my view&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MY VIEW:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
1. His desire/decision/plan to stay together with her (for all of October, November, December, January, and February) for the sake of not having to rearrange things during his mum visiting and to &amp;quot;avoid blindsiding her&amp;quot; is a completely inadequate reason. It appears to value avoiding some distant future inconvenience over losing me.&lt;br/&gt;
2. His hope/expectation that i&amp;#39;ll contently sit on the sidelines (without any actual promise or evidence that my investment into &amp;#39;us&amp;#39; is leading to anything real) seems completely deranged. I&amp;#39;ve said from the beginning that I won&amp;#39;t sit around waiting indefinitely. To add to this, he refuses to give any actual promises other than he&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;doing his best&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;inching towards things&amp;quot;. This is straying into Carrie Fisher in When Harry Met Sally territory, the same words that thousands of women have mistaken for promises and hope in the absence of any real evidence. He appears to have no comprehension or care re: the emotional impact that would have on me (or anyone in that situation) which indicates a worrying lack of empathy, love, and insight.&lt;br/&gt;
3. He truly believes that doing something in the short term (e.g. actually telling her he&amp;#39;s unhappy with the marriage, or moving into spare room) would &amp;quot;brutally traumatise&amp;quot; his parents, his son, and lead to a resentful hatred from his wife. He also believes that if he waits 5 months before saying/doing something, then that will be avoided. This doesn&amp;#39;t seem based in reality to me, and doesn&amp;#39;t address that things will still be just as hard in 5 months (potentially ever moving goal posts). Is this a man whose simply not ready to leave? Or the signs of a cowardly and selfish man that&amp;#39;d hurt people around him for the sake of saving face (e.g. not being the bad guy?).&lt;br/&gt;
4. Each &amp;#39;action&amp;#39; step taken so far (talking to a counselor, making a pros/cons list, working through his fears, deciding where he&amp;#39;d live and the budget, researching custody arrangements) has been fairly pressured by me, as in all things he says he wouldn&amp;#39;t have done without me asking. The two concrete things he&amp;#39;d agreed to do at home have both been reneged. He had agreed to (sometime in the following couple of months) to have a conversation with her about being unhappy and to suggest him sleeping in the spare room for a while (my suggestions), then when brought up again he instead listed reasons why that wasn&amp;#39;t actually possible in the next couple of months (that it would &amp;quot;risk losing his son&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;screw up o much with the whole family&amp;quot;), and even a suggestion that i&amp;#39;d been mistaken that he&amp;#39;d even agreed to that in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;
5. Being honest with myself, waiting around as a secret on the side for another five (or who really knows how many) months would breed resentment and anger in me. I already increasingly feel like i&amp;#39;m just an option, not a priority. He says that losing me would be the greatest regret of his life, yet I feel like while he&amp;#39;s saying that, he&amp;#39;s actively pouncing on opportunities where us splitting up would be my choice (indicating that he wouldn&amp;#39;t even really care?). I&amp;#39;m worried that this is him doing the bare minimum to keep me from leaving so as to disrupt his routine as little as possible. I&amp;#39;ve brought this up and the reaction was his feelings being hurt at the suggestion he doesn&amp;#39;t care, but zero reassurances provided to be other than that he loves me.&lt;br/&gt;
6. He admits that many of his major life decisions have been made through convenience and conflict avoidance (path of least resistance). In this sense, I am able to guide things by applying reasonable pressure and support. This leaves me torn between doing what I think is right for everyone (separating whether or not it&amp;#39;s to be with me, and doing it earlier rather than later so she&amp;#39;s got the holiday period to sort things out for her and the son + not using her in a fake marriage just for the convenience factor   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;#39;s left out here is the day-to-day love, fun, respect and affection in our relationship. This will read like a foolish girl being tricked by another bullshitting man having his cake and eating it to, where-as we are each other&amp;#39;s best friend and life together is pretty perfect except for the fact that he&amp;#39;s got to rush home to another woman each evening. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXTRA CONSIDERATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
1. She most likely thinks he&amp;#39;s just going through a grumpy patch. Fighting is normal for them, so she may not have even noticed that it&amp;#39;s intensified lately. Ultimately, they are by and large living married life no different to any other year including no change in their daily routine (dinner together each day, sleeping in same bed each night, raising their son together as normal).&lt;br/&gt;
2. She will most likely be more vigilant during this deterioration, presumably drastically reducing the time he&amp;#39;s able to spend with me.&lt;br/&gt;
3. I am absolutely opposed to the idea of &amp;#39;waiting on the sidelines&amp;#39; for another 4-6+ months. I&amp;#39;ve said many times that I have no intention of sitting around alone wondering what&amp;#39;s happening over xmas/new year. His counter argument is to simply say that he&amp;#39;ll hate every second of those holidays with her, but then no explanation why that&amp;#39;s the choice he&amp;#39;s leaning towards.&lt;br/&gt;
4. He&amp;#39;s putting her in charge of directing the timeline and conversations of the split (hopeful that it&amp;#39;ll deteriorate &amp;#39;naturally&amp;#39; over time (once he stops providing input in terms of smoothing over conflicts and tensions), but at the same time acknowledges that he&amp;#39;s certain she&amp;#39;s perfectly happy to continue indefinitely the way things are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MM/AP said he will separate to be with me, but saying he needs at least 6-months before anything concrete will start to happen (to have full custody when his parents visit in Nov and Jan, and to make the separation feel more mutual by letting the marriage deteriorate over xmas). Asking me to wait for him, but refuses to promise me anything. He thinks i&amp;#39;m being unreasonably impatient and trying to rush things, and I think he&amp;#39;s dragging out the inevitable for the sake of cowardice and selfish personal convenience. Am I the unfairly impatient asshole or the stupid fool?&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"My (30f) husband (31M) and I have been married for 5 years, together for 13 years. We met when we were both 16 and have been together ever since. We had a really unhealthy relationship for a very long time, mostly due to immaturity, but I got pregnant at the age of 21 so we decided to try our best to make it work. He asked me to marry him while I was pregnant and I said yes, even though it didn’t fully feel “right”. Fast forward to today, we have 3 kids together, a house, and a whole life. For the most part, we have made it work. However, I’m not happy. We fight all the time and he becomes super petty when we do. Our latest argument was this morning when he went to go get gas and took our toddler with him. I was in the shower when they left and didn’t know. I came downstairs and couldn’t find my 2 year old. I panicked. I called him a million times and he didn’t answer. When they finally got home, I breathed a huge sigh of relief and then flipped out on him. He scared me to death! He called me a “selfish bitch” because he thought he was doing me a favor by taking him along for the ride. We haven’t spoken since and he left for work. He also took all the money with him, leaving me home with 3 kids and not a cent on me. This is just a stupid little example, but things like this happen pretty often. 

I’m also just not happy in general. Maybe this is my own personal issue, but I never truly experienced dating life, or being with anyone outside of my husband, and I guess there’s a part of me that feels like I settled, even though the relationship wasn’t healthy. We got pregnant during make-up sex. He cheated on me multiple times before that. I was desperately in love with him and put all of my self worth into him. I accepted the way he treated me and our relationship because I felt like I couldn’t live without him. I was a stupid teenager with no self worth. 

Now I’m much older, much more mature, and feel like my self confidence has grown so much, especially since having children and needing to be a strong woman for them. My husband has turned into a great father and I know he NOW loves me more than life itself. He’s really turned himself around and is a completely different person. However, I’m not on the same page anymore. He’s my best friend, but I don’t feel that love and passion anymore. I feel like we fight pretty often, and he gets super immature and petty when we do. As soon as that happens, I feel like we are 16 again and I just want to get up and leave him. 

I’m a stay at home mom. I don’t make any money for myself. He owns the home. He owns the cars. His paycheck pays all the bills and for our entire life. I don’t want to uproot the kids.

,Divorce,"Hello wonderful people of Reddit, I come to you now in my hour of need. I am faced with an impossible situation that I simply cannot face. 

I am a divorced father with 4 year old who I love with all my heart. My ex decided one day without telling me that she had just up and left the town and moved in with her new partner. We were working on a joint custody whereby we each have her equally during the week. Due to childcare requirements each would fill their part and organised childcare with the same provider. Since we were both in the same town this wasn't an issue and could be done quite easily. My ex also agreed that her partner would be moving to our town and she wouldn't be changing our kid's schedule since friends had been made in the area.

For some this may not be an issue but for me, this is the biggest issue. I love my kid to bits and I know that my kid would rather spend every day with me. Every time we go through the rota and we are due to swap I always have to hear ""I don't want to go to my mum"". 

My ex had a mental break a couple of days ago and wanted me to take full custody because she just couldn't handle it by herself, she wasn't with her partner for parts of the week and since our kid wanted to be with me, she broke down and told me that I should take her for the majority of the time. The next day she presents the above, she has moved to another town and now wants her for the full working week since she has in-laws that can take care of our kid.

,Divorce,"9 months ago, in an attempt to fix the marriage relationship, I was negotiating with my ex wife the possibilities to make the marriage work. I did put some conditions. My ex also had her conditions too. We both never agreed. Both of us believed and still believe we are right. 
I remember that I suggested a temporary separation to give each of us the chance to think clearly about the marriage relationship at that time. But, one month after, my ex and her parents started pushing for the divorce. While indeed it was me the person who said rant if things will continue like this, we’d rather divorce, I never meant we should divorce anytime soon. I wanted to give her a free space to think about making our relationship work.
After noticing that my ex and her family wanted to divorce, I was at a shock as I felt I was like a useless object they tried to get rid of. They knew that I was going to lose my good job three months after the divorce. Also, they knew I may have a hard time finding a similar job. 
For me, divorce does not mean anything. As I truly loved my ex wife. If she showed me any sorts of love or she wanted to go, I was easily going to go back to her. All I got later is a cold treatment. She never showed any sorts of love.

I can't sleep very well.

I love you. I have for 13 years, now. You are my world. You are my partner. You are my best friend. 

I don't know what this new future brings. To be honest, I'm scared of a life without you in it. But I'm hopeful that if anyone can do it and still love each other, it's us. 

I often wonder if we met now, with a little more life under our belts, if we'd have a better chance. Of not hurting the other. And understanding how to better care for one another. 

The truth is I don't know. And it doesn't help to wonder about things that have no answer.

,Divorce,"I was divorced 4 years ago. It was traumatic at the time, but we get along fine now. Anyway, I recently got a letter from my dental insurance provider telling me my ex used the dental insurance the month after the divorce, and now they want me to pay them back for the benefits they paid out at the time. 

If that were the whole story, it would be a clear-cut case of fraud on her part. The only thing is, I messed up too. I am not sure I notified the insurance company in a timely manner about the divorce (I thought I had called, but I have no proof). I also know I told her not to use the health insurance after the divorce, but I didn't specifically tell her not to use the dental insurance. To further complicate matters, the health insurance had a 30 day grace period after the divorce, but the dental insurance didn't. So that would be easy to mix up.

Anyway, I recently got a letter from my dental insurance provider telling me my ex used the dental insurance the month after the divorce, and now they want me to pay them back for the benefits they paid out at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that were the whole story, it would be a clear-cut case of fraud on her part. The only thing is, I messed up too. I am not sure I notified the insurance company in a timely manner about the divorce (I thought I had called, but I have no proof). I also know I told her not to use the health insurance after the divorce, but I didn&amp;#39;t specifically tell her not to use the dental insurance. To further complicate matters, the health insurance had a 30 day grace period after the divorce, but the dental insurance didn&amp;#39;t. So that would be easy to mix up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this bill?

My husband and I have been married for two years. We have an 8 month old son and are living in an apartment. About a year into the marriage, he began threatening divorce frequently. He had me delete all social media, and I work with my mom providing virtual bookkeeping and accounting services - so I don’t have much interaction with anyone outside of my immediate family. Last night, he asked me to stop talking to my two best friends because he went through my phone and saw where I had been telling one about how depressing I feel my life is. (What mom/parent hasn’t had those feelings?) I didn’t say anything bad about him or our marriage. When I asked if I could at least tell them good bye, he got livid and decided he was “done with me for good.” I didn’t feel like begging for him to stay with me because I’m tired of the ultimatums and isolation. Neither of us have any where else to go and finances are already tight, so we decided to continue to live together until our lease is up. We just re-signed the lease in August, so it’ll be a while. In SC, you have to show separate addresses for a year before you can file for divorce, so I’m technically no where near actually divorcing for quite some time. 

I guess I’m just looking for advice - has anyone lived with their ex for financial/children/commitment reasons? I know this could turn extremely sour, so I’m doing my best to learn how to be separated without actually being separated. What boundaries are fair to set? How did you learn to detach yourself? I realize the best solution would be to get out. However, this is just not feasible for me right now. 

Ultimately, my main concern is for the sake of my son.  I am making my daily intention to not give into the jabs or comments my husband has lined up for me, because that will only create a toxic environment for my son. I want to learn how to no longer be concerned or absorbed with what my husband is doing and just focus on my son.

,Divorce,"After nearly nine years together, I recently made the very hard decision to leave my husband. We have only been married for two years but we spent almost all of our 20s together. I was deeply madly in love and never would have imagined that I would be in this situation. Yet all these years later I am the one leaving the husband I thought I couldn’t live without. After a few recent hard years of asking for more and explaining away the things I wasn’t getting...I was pushed to my breaking point. It was a moment in which I had a very real, very sudden and tear-filled realization that “I love this person too much” and from that moment I watched my relationship crumble. 

What I quickly realized was that the relationship was like a sad, empty house that I filled with beautiful delusions and words of encouragement “all you need is love” - “at least we love each other” - “it won’t be like this forever” -  “I can live without that” - “this is what marriage is” - “it’s not that he doesn’t love me” - but that beautiful relationship that I was so dedicated to was actually a friendship full of disappointments. 

Once the realization came, the clarity was overwhelming...I could now see all the things that didn’t make me happy, all the reasons I couldn’t be in this relationship anymore. The fundamental differences in who we had become that would make it impossible to truly ever make each other happy again.  I knew that I could never go back, and didn’t want to. So I began “trying to move forward and move on”

This next phase was emotional but this new-found clarity was so fresh and so “in my face” that anger and the self empowerment got me through my days without breaking down. But now as I sit here, with the freshness of this realization aging, I also realize that this person has been my best friend for 9 years...someone only 6 months ago I thought I couldn’t live without. And now the sadness and the grief hits me at the most random moments. Moments when I want to tell him about something exciting that happened or text him about a football game. In these moments I feel a deep ache, one of sadness that I have lost someone once so dear to me. 

Conflict and confusion: Despite these debilitating moments of grief and loss of this relationship, I know that it is the right decision. Never in my life have I felt so heartbroken, conflicted, justified and guilty at the same time. I am excited and terrified and absolutely devastated that this person I once built a life and future with, will no longer be in my life. Not only am I grieving the death of my marriage but am grieving the loss of my best friend, the kids we will never have, the adventures we will never take...all while knowing this is how it has to be. 

While I know we can never be together again as the people we have become, I mourn the beautiful relationship that blossomed over so many years, but that developed into something dull with sadness and distance. Looking at nine years of photos, I can see the blossoming and the closeness evolve, but as I scroll I can also see the distance increase and the smiles grow smaller and smaller. How terribly tragic it is to see something that was once so beautiful, end up like this.

,Divorce,"So, this happened earlier and I need to write it out while it is fresh. 

Today, our son turned 9. We have been doing the 2-2-3 schedule, and it was technically my STBXW's day with the children. Our son didn't want to spend the evening in the car making the 45 minute trek and asked to stay home and celebrate. 

I finished teaching and started setting everything up. They arrived an hour later, she dropped the kids and left to get a cookie cake. 

Over the last few months she has refused to pay a single bill that is solely linked to her. She had a new bank account with thousands in it, locked me out of joint business accounts (and the money that originally routed to a joint checking account), and continued to force me into paying thousands a month for her bills. These were separate from joint debts, mortgage, utilities, groceries, etc.

I had managed to sell a few things and pull some extra cash for the birthday. I was headed to get dinner to cook when I realized I needed to gas my Jeep. 

Being that I have paid $652 a month for months since separation/divorce initiation, I walked back in and asked my wife to use the van. She was sitting down with the girls. I didn't think it would be a huge deal. 

She started getting aggressive and asking why I wanted the van. I told her I needed gas and was driving less than 3 miles round trip. She continued to be irate and then, the moment my hand touched the van key, she got violent.

She started punching me, clawing me and biting me over these damn van keys...ALL IN FRONT OF OUR YOUNGEST DAUGHTERS!

Luckily, our son was in our room waiting for us to finish decorating. 

I have multiple full teeth bite marks on the back of my right arm, inside my left arm and a raised, bruised bite mark on my forearm. She also clawed at my face and behind my ears, as well as kicked me multiple times. 

We moved away from the children and into the playroom. That's when she started getting violent again, then threatened to call 911 on me. This was as she grabbed at my shirt, bit at my chest, then completely ripped it apart. 

I was stunned. 

I started filming, and even then she was punching and kicking me (to the point the phone was knocked out my hand and the video stopped).

I ended up with the van key and walked outside. She chased me down waiting to get in. I asked why she was being this way and what she was hiding that would rationalize domestic violence in front of our children on our son's birthday. She pulled three bags and went inside.

Turns out, it was the Adderall prescription she had lied about earlier that day that hadn't filled yet. Funny enough, just days ago she was messaging me that she knew she needed a therapist and to get off Adderall completely. (In the last few months, she was up to 60-80 mg daily). 

So all of that insanity over asking for and touching the van keys, just to protect her lie.

Back inside, she then started yelling at all the children to pack up and they were headed to her parents (45 minutes away). Our son was balling his eyes out. He is the oldest and definitely the most cognizant of what's going on. 

He was broken hearted and shaking, saying it was the worst birthday ever. 

I loaded him up to go with me to the grocery store, didn't talk about the events that took place beyond, ""I'm sorry you had to witness that."" 

I filled up my tank with the little cash I have right now, got groceries (and a few boxes of candy he chose) then helped make the night turn around for the best.

He fell asleep happy, saying it was a great morning, quickly went downhill, but ended much better. That made my heart happy.

The only thing stopping me from calling the cops and having her in handcuffs for the second time in 2 months is his birthday.

This Wednesday, we finally have our first mediation. Beyond over this woman and ready to be free as I can be.

,Divorce,"I'm 15, and don't know where else to go to let out my feelings. Thus this post on reddit.

I first had known things weren't right when I was 13. My mom had told me she suspected my dad of cheating. A few days later she confirmed it and told me about it. My first reaction was anger, angry that my dad had thrown away this family, angry that I was in this situation. When I was 13 it was really rough on me, and it still is but in a different way. I obsessed over it and couldn't get out of bed every morning. It was hard for me to find happiness in my mundane schedule. I saw how things continued to get worse. I saw my mom cry over him. i heard the fights. My dad wasn't willing to stop seeing his mistress and honestly it's even worse now 2 years later. 2 years ago I ignored my dad, I took my anger out on him.

But they dragged their relationship on. Which tbh was worse for me. I kept my feelings to myself knowing my mom is going through way more and way worse.

Now 2 years later I'm not angry anymore. I just wish it would stop, that they'd stop pretending it was okay to drag on this loveless relationship. I want to cherish whatever relationship I have left with my dad, before he leaves and completely abandons this family. Because of that my mom thinks I'm choosing him over her and my dad thinks this whole thing isn't affecting me at all. He comes home late, barely talks to us anymore. He'd go out days on end and tell me a legit reason that I'd believe. But I'm still hoping for them to work it out..even though that's unrealistic. My mom tells me things and honestly, now I don't even want to hear it. I know she's hurting but sometimes I wished they'd ask me how I felt.

I just feel really lost and hopeless. I've been avoiding this, pretending this didn't exist so I wouldn't be as sad and hurt everyday. But even though that hurt what hurts the most is not knowing who I can depend on anymore. I don't have the best relationship with both my grandparents. My grandfather on my mom's side died last year and they take out their anger on this situation on me. I often hear my grandmother tell my mom if she didn't have children, she could leave whenever she wanted. As a child I really looked up to her, i guess it hurt to hear that I was such a burden. While my grandparents on my dad's side just never really liked me, they're very old fashioned and didn't like that I wasn't a boy. Im just hurt that I feel unwanted everywhere. My mom said they're probably getting divorced soon. Part of me wants them to just end it and stop my hopes of them getting back together. But the other part of me wished they'd get back together and go back to how it was before all this...The worst part is that I still love my dad, even after everything he's said and everything he's done i don't want him out of my life. 

I try to not think about it, and everyone thinks I'm doing okay but I just cope by not talking about it hoping it'd go away. I don't really know what to do. High school + this is really overwhelming. I try to focus on school and friends. I wish I was good enough to make people stay. Sorry for this sloppily written post, I just wanted to get some things that I haven't been able to get off my chest out there.

He&amp;#39;d go out days on end and tell me a legit reason that I&amp;#39;d believe. But I&amp;#39;m still hoping for them to work it out..even though that&amp;#39;s unrealistic. My mom tells me things and honestly, now I don&amp;#39;t even want to hear it. I know she&amp;#39;s hurting but sometimes I wished they&amp;#39;d ask me how I felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel really lost and hopeless. I&amp;#39;ve been avoiding this, pretending this didn&amp;#39;t exist so I wouldn&amp;#39;t be as sad and hurt everyday. But even though that hurt what hurts the most is not knowing who I can depend on anymore. I don&amp;#39;t have the best relationship with both my grandparents. My grandfather on my mom&amp;#39;s side died last year and they take out their anger on this situation on me. I often hear my grandmother tell my mom if she didn&amp;#39;t have children, she could leave whenever she wanted. As a child I really looked up to her, i guess it hurt to hear that I was such a burden. While my grandparents on my dad&amp;#39;s side just never really liked me, they&amp;#39;re very old fashioned and didn&amp;#39;t like that I wasn&amp;#39;t a boy. Im just hurt that I feel unwanted everywhere. My mom said they&amp;#39;re probably getting divorced soon. Part of me wants them to just end it and stop my hopes of them getting back together. But the other part of me wished they&amp;#39;d get back together and go back to how it was before all this...The worst part is that I still love my dad, even after everything he&amp;#39;s said and everything he&amp;#39;s done i don&amp;#39;t want him out of my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to not think about it, and everyone thinks I&amp;#39;m doing okay but I just cope by not talking about it hoping it&amp;#39;d go away. I don&amp;#39;t really know what to do. High school + this is really overwhelming. I try to focus on school and friends. I wish I was good enough to make people stay. Sorry for this sloppily written post, I just wanted to get some things that I haven&amp;#39;t been able to get off my chest out there. Sorry if I sound selfish or anything in this post, it could be because of how emotional I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone could offer some advice I&amp;#39;d like that alot.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"My STBX is an alcoholic who’s diagnosed with PTSD.  We’ve been together for 17 years and have two kids (one in middle school, one in elementary school) with special needs. He’s been unfaithful, violent to me on several occasions when he drinks. I finally drew the line a few weeks ago when he was supposed to staying home with my pre-teen son who was home sick from school but decided to drink almost a fifth of vodka and go out and drive to go get lunch, leaving my sick son home alone. 

Prior to this incident, I have begged, screamed, cried, everything I can think of to get him to get help for his mental health issues. He eventually would go to therapy for a while, but stopped as soon as he started feeling “better” without ever really addressing his underlying issues. I, on the other hand, have been to therapy consistently and been traumatized by his physical abuse. Following the most recent incident, he was in a mental health facility after I called 911 when he threatened suicide over the incident. I filed for divorce the day after because I refuse to put my kids in danger because of his unwillingness to commit to getting help. My kids have already seen him be violent with me and I can’t let his illness affect them anymore. 

I have a restraining order out on him now and he hasn’t seen the kids in weeks. It has been really tough because I don’t really have much of a support system and being a single parent to two kids who are very hurt and confused is very tough.

Maybe there was, I do know there was something worth fighting over, always.

I had papers ready to go again last winter when I discovered the extent of his drinking.

I told him as much and he begged me to give him a chance again.

Because I believe he loves his kid and is as good to her as he can be, and because I was afraid to blow up our status quo and end up financially ruined, I backed off.

I'm almost to the point where I'm willing to walk away from this incredibly special homestead we worked on together.

I'm willing to watch the rest of my nest egg dwindle to nothing in court fees and judgements and I'm willing to put my daughter through the emotional torture of a family breakup, if only not to spend any more of our precious time living in this mind-fuck of a home.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sick of my daughter watching me cry, I&amp;#39;m sick of having to explain why we are almost never in the same room or having to tell her we are just talking when we are obviously about to pop off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sick of wanting to get done with work so badly and wanting to go home to realize I don&amp;#39;t want to be there or near him at all.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"My wife is leaving me after 15 years of marriage. We have three kids aged 10 and under. My wife told me she wanted to separate at the beginning of this year and told me she had started seeing someone else six weeks later. Last night she told me she was ready to tell the kids and to move out. We’ve just been dealing with this all year. She leaves the house and doesn’t come home 2-3 nights a week. I’ve just been hanging in there and lying to the kids. She moved into the office and she mostly avoids me. I've seen her be very neglectful and short-tempered with the kids. In the future, I want to at least be able to tell the kids I did my best to keep it together. Now I have to prepare myself for this conversation with the kids, for her moving out, and for arriving at a custody agreement.

I’m not without blame in our marriage, but I’ve maintained throughout all of this that I want her to stay and to try and work things out. I’m probably an okay husband with some qualities and some flaws. But I’m a great dad who is very dedicated and who takes fatherhood very seriously. I made some mistakes in our marriage many years ago but I’ve tried very hard to be a good husband since then. I think my wife was into the parts of our marriage that involved making babies and building a home, but now we’re in the difficult part, with three young kids who need a lot of attention. She’s not about that. Many days are a struggle in this house even when things are going well.

I’m mortified about the future for my kids. I blame my wife for putting her own welfare in front of the kids. She doesn’t know what divorce does to kids. My parents divorced when I was very young and it was traumatic for me. She has no idea what her actions are putting the kids through. I really have so much blame for my wife. I think I’ll probably be fine, eventually. Some of these days are very hard, including today. But I’ll figure things out.

But the kids are going to have some tough times ahead. So now I have to sit down with my wife and frame our separation and her moving out as something that’s not terrible. I know the right conversation is to highlight our continued sources of stability (which is me and this house and their friends, etc.), to be optimistic, to assure them it’s not their fault, that things are going to be fine. I have to position my wife and I as co-parents and partners, all working together to be a great family, just in a different situation. But I can’t get past how I feel. I don’t want to lie to them. 

What I feel is that she lacks emotional intelligence, that she’s selfish, and that she cares more about herself than the kids. I have to take such a high road and I don’t know how. I don’t know how to do this conversation. I want to let her tell the kids and to just sit next to her, and when they ask me why, I want to tell them their mother wants this, not me. I want to let her explain her feelings - she feels sad, alone, neglected, trapped - while I stick with the facts - your mother wants to end our family, your mother is seeing someone else, your mother is moving to an apartment somewhere. But I know I have to take the high road.

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I plan to have a meeting without future ex. My son needs support and love from his siblings and the other children deserve to know the truth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so frustrated and honestly hurt that future ex can&amp;#39;t put his feelings aside and focus on the children right now. I know he&amp;#39;s in pain, just as we all are, but the kids need love more than ever right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That aside, I guess I have to start my &amp;quot;speech&amp;quot; with this line, I&amp;#39;ve decided to end my marriage due to unresolved problems with your father. ... I&amp;#39;VE DECIDED. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the truth but it&amp;#39;s still a really shitty place that he&amp;#39;s put me in.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Let's start what the basics. Before i met my wife (and soon to be ex-wife...) i had never kissed a girl. Never had sex. Never even had a female friend. Barely having any friends at all. I felt unloved, alone and like a loser.

I was studying in another city and through a giant coincidence i started writing to this girl i talked to on twitter. For the first time ever a woman took interest in me and my weird personality.The following weekend i met her (in another city 200 km away). We hit it off, she kissed me, we had sex. I stayed the whole weekend and for the first time in my life i was happy.From that point life moved rather quickly, we got married barely one year later, had a daughter (2014), than a son(2017).

I were 27 when i met her. These 6 years have been the happiest in my life. The only happy years even. And now it's over.

In the beginning of this year she told me she THINKS she wants a divorce. I of course were shocked, i asked why. She stated her reason as life have been ""moving to fast"", that she ""doesn't know who she are anymore"". But for some reason she also stated ""But i still love you, your still the best thing that ever happened to me and also my best friend"". She told me she just wants to live alone and figure things out. But she is not sure this is what she wants... Fast forward....Some days later she texts me, tells me that she don't want divorce. That she wants to try, try counseling and make everything work. I feel like a giant load is taken off me. All the anxiety, depression etc vanishes.

So life goes on, as usual... Then a couple months later she wants to talk again. Now she tells me she wants to divorce. That she don't love me anymore (how the fuck does one stop loving another after 3 months???). She ensures me there's no-one else. She has no intent on starting to date. She just wanna live alone and have her own life.2 months later she gets together with a guy at work.. Behind my back. When we were still living together....I got replaced.... We used to talk every day for as long as we knew each other. Last time i got a text from her were 2 days ago... I'm never getting used to this. I have no-one to talk to.

I get to have the kids every 2nd week... The weeks without my kids i just feel alone, disoriented and pathetic. I'm never gonna find anyone else loving me for what i am, like she did. I don't even know how to move on from here. My looks is probably way under average.... And socially I'm awful. My hobbies and interests are pathetic. I don't know how to talk to people, except for my ex-wife which was the only women i ever felt connected to. I miss her every day. I miss my love. I miss my best friend. I still don't even know why she left me. Whenever i have asked she just says that she dont love my anymore. No reasons. No facts. Nothing concrete at all.  


Every day feel like a challenge and i just wanna give up. I wanna stop breathing but I'm too scared to do something about it... I seriously see no point at all to living.

,Divorce,"It's been awhile since my last post. I've been pretty busy trying to sort my life out.


I still haven't reconciled with my bio uncle after the events in June.


My divorce from STBXH is going smoothly. We remain civil, though it's been suggested he has been having an affair, and has even already moved out of our old domicile. I dont care.


I got a job, making minimum wage, full time. It's enough to pay the bills. But I've had to borrow 1200$ from a friend to get a car for work, because STBXH wouldn't help. Even though it's his fault I'm in this position to begin with. His lack of any true support is actually pretty pathetic. It's been four months and hes just gotten around to sending me two flat rate boxes (a small fraction) of my possessions.


He recently had the audacity to say I could talk to him about anything and he'd always be there for me. Bull. Anything to ease his concious, I'm sure. Once I have all my most important objects back, he will forever be written off, never to hear from or see me again. I hope my suffering has been worth him finding his happiness.


I've been fortunate enough that I have been easily able to find and obtain supplemental ""support"" from some new friends. Each one serves a purpose, and they understand their place. After years of a near sexless and affectionless marriage, I deserve to have my safe, adult fun, while I'm young.


Overall, I'm doing alright. I get by. I'll never live in comfort or security like I did before, but at least I wont be living someone else's lie either. I suspect it will be a long time before I feel anything like romantic love again. And honestly, I'm more than okay with that.

&lt;p&gt;I got a job, making minimum wage, full time. It&amp;#39;s enough to pay the bills. But I&amp;#39;ve had to borrow 1200$ from a friend to get a car for work, because STBXH wouldn&amp;#39;t help. Even though it&amp;#39;s his fault I&amp;#39;m in this position to begin with. His lack of any true support is actually pretty pathetic. It&amp;#39;s been four months and hes just gotten around to sending me two flat rate boxes (a small fraction) of my possessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He recently had the audacity to say I could talk to him about anything and he&amp;#39;d always be there for me. Bull. Anything to ease his concious, I&amp;#39;m sure. Once I have all my most important objects back, he will forever be written off, never to hear from or see me again. I hope my suffering has been worth him finding his happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been fortunate enough that I have been easily able to find and obtain supplemental &amp;quot;support&amp;quot; from some new friends. Each one serves a purpose, and they understand their place. After years of a near sexless and affectionless marriage, I deserve to have my safe, adult fun, while I&amp;#39;m young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;#39;m doing alright. I get by. I&amp;#39;ll never live in comfort or security like I did before, but at least I wont be living someone else&amp;#39;s lie either. I suspect it will be a long time before I feel anything like romantic love again. And honestly, I&amp;#39;m more than okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything will be finalized very soon. I look forward to my sock day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m worrying about the little details. How do I do this as quickly as possible? How do I get money to live on in the interim? I can open a bank account and have my checks deposited there but we have basically no money in the bank right now. I think my wife intentionally spent as much money as possible lately in order to prevent me from leaving. We&amp;#39;ve got less than 1k in the bank and 16k in various credit cards, I&amp;#39;m only an authorized user on most of them. I cold open a credit card in my name only and use that for deposits and furniture for a new place, right? My score is sitting around 730. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I left the house without a custody agreement in place would that put me in a disadvantage? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep getting lost in the little details and frozen in place.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Hello everyone! Thank you for creating this space to share and request advice and support.  I am about to file for a divorce and could use some help.  This is a new experience for me, so I am providing information using the ""First Time Posters"" guideline.  I sincerely apologize for the length.  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!

About us:

* Me: Male, age 37.  Spouse: Male, age 40.
* Relationship: Same-sex couple together for 16 years.  Legally married 5 years ago in California.  Family currently resides in Indiana.
* Kids: Three kids (elementary school age) via joint-adoption from foster care, one foster kid (elementary school age).
* Rest of in-home family unit: mother-in-law (in her 60s), one dog, one tortoise, and some chickens.
* Home: A house in the mother-in-law's name.  Spouse and I pay half of the mortgage.
* Other big assets: One car and one minivan, relatively new. We're still paying the loan on both cars. Both cars are in both of our name.  He has a computer which he has a loan in his name and we have game systems.  There are no stocks, properties in our name, or other big items in our name.  Most of the furniture in the house is his or we got jointly.

Process:

* At this time, neither of us have an attorney.  We are trying to come to an agreement without incurring large legal fees.
* The family unit is still all living within the home, though my husband has stated he wants me out of the home ASAP.  Advice on this sub and websites recommend staying in the home for legal reasons, but family and friends are advising me to leave ASAP before he becomes vindictive.

Reasons for the Divorce:

* I am requesting the divorce.  After years of poor communication and connection, I do not think we can repair the marriage.  There are arguments weekly, sometimes daily, between us.  It is impacting the lives of everyone in the family unit.
* We have been in marriage counseling weekly for three months.  The counselor is a good mediator.  The sessions have brought out aspects of ourselves that we need to work on, but has not led to repairing the marriage.
* Additionally, both my spouse and I have been in individual counseling.  In working with my therapist as well as discussion with family and friends, I have started to realize and admit that my husband has been emotionally abusing me for years and continues to do so, as well as that he has sexually abused me in the past and this year.
* Although I love him and will always love him because he has been a major part of my life, I have fallen out of love with him.  Unfortunately, the spark and desire for anything romantic with him has left me.

Emotionally I am:

* After months of being scared and angry, I am now mostly calm.  I feel some weight has been lifted off my shoulders now that I have made the decision.  It feels like there is an end in sight to the cycle of dealing with arguments and belittlement.  I think I have accepted what has happened in the past and want to move forward.
* I am even excited sometimes.  I had given up on my self esteem, my hobbies, my friendships, and my dreams to make him happy.  Now I feel like there's a chance I can do things that make me happy and be with people that want me around.  I also want to focus on being a better dad without having to manage negative impacts from my spouse.
* I am still worried.  I have never been great with change and executing big decisions. I worry about how my kids will be impacted. Our three  adopted kids were in the foster system and lost connection with most of their birth family members.  Our foster kid will likely be moved to a different placement.
* I am hopeful for my husband.  He did not to separate, but I sincerely don't feel like I am the right person to support him in the ways he wants and needs support.  I genuinely want him to have a break to work on himself and then find someone else who will make him delighted and happy the way we used to be.

What I am requesting for help:

* Link to a good checklist for steps toward moving out and divorcing.  One benefit to the marriage therapy is I learned I may have undiagnosed ADD and that checklists really help me process and get things done.
* Thoughts on child custody .  I am the breadwinner, and my job requires me to work overnight shift plus occasional Saturday overnights.  My husband has been a stay-at-home spouse/dad for several years at his request, and he also homeschools the older three children.  I think it's in the kids' best interest to stay with him during the week, and I have custody on Sundays.  I would like to see them more, but may not be possible with spouse's opinion and my work schedule.  Is that fair and appropriate?
* Thoughts on alimony/maintenance.  I am the primary income of the home.  My mother-in-law receives retirement and Social Security income which pays for her part of the mortgage and her expenses. The children each get Adoption Subsidy assistance from the state (total \~$2,000 monthly).  My husband is the only person who brings in no income.  I do expect to pay child support and  maintenance, but realistically what should I expect to pay?  For all the bills and expenses, or will the court expect him to get a job?
* Advice and support.  I don't know anyone who has been in a long-term marriage and initated a divorce other than my mother (who has been supportive).  I don't know any fellow LGBTQIA+ who have been through a divorce, much less a divorce with kids.

Rant or vent:

* I am having negative feelings about myself for having allowed this to go on for so long, and for thinking that love could fix our relationship.
* I am still processing a recent argument where my spouse was upset that I didn't have a fully formed plan of separating and moving out.  I am trying to recognize that he is autistic (high-functioning) and needs a plan to feel more secure, and also that he feels he is the victim here as I am the one requesting the divorce.  However, I feel it is unfair that comparing my process of preparing to the divorce to his process from when his first spouse (female) divorced him and he only needed a week to leave.

Family court:

* I do not wish to seek any justice or retribution.  I sincerely want both of us to have an amicable co-parenting relationship after the divorce, and for both my spouse and I to get
* My priority is that the kids have a stable living situation.  I understand that will likely mean I will see my kids less, thought I do hope I will retain joint legal custody and at least partial physical custody.

SBTX behavior:

* Other than trying to keep finances stable until we split, I do not wish to dictate what he does.  In fact, I do hope that he increases his socialization and goes for his dreams once stress in the home is reduced.

&lt;p&gt;I know myself well enough to know that when I have something post here I&amp;#39;m in a moment of need or some minor pain.  And in the past week or so I&amp;#39;ve posted a lot more than I did in recent months.  If you were to map my post history against the ups and downs of how I&amp;#39;ve felt over the past year it would be a graph with clean overlap.  I come to this place to write when I sad, confused, pained or otherwise struggling.  When things are good to I read it and try to answer questions, but I don&amp;#39;t post as much.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can say is that act of writing is helpful and I am very appreciative of having this forum as a place to do so.  I also love hearing other people&amp;#39;s stories and, more than anything, being able to STEP OUTSIDE of my own bubble and actually offer some solace to others.  That is really the most rewarding thing....and it helps one realize that the experience has been worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So write. Bitch. Moan. Vent. Put it all on the page.  You&amp;#39;ll feel better and you&amp;#39;ll find kindred spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll try to make this short. Married 5 years, have twins. Currently separated. Husband has Schizoaffective disorder. Also has a drinking problem.

Never went back into the job force because my husband started making a great salary. Three months ago, out of the blue, he tells me he’s “not happy” and “doesn’t want this anymore”. Fast forward to today and he has moved himself into the guest room and is ready to move forward with selling our house that we only bought a couple of years ago and ready to separate and eventually divorce. 

I thought our marriage was great. I loved this man with all my heart. He’s my best friend, my everything—and now I know what a mistake that was. He’s been contemplating leaving for a year. I don’t know if another woman is involved but he adamantly denies it. I used to trust him with everything and now I can’t tell lies from the truth because he hasn’t been honest with me for so long. 

I feel completely and utterly lost and broken. I have no family or friends in my city, just my 13 year old daughter, who is also hurting.

I rolled over one May morning to find her sweet love texts sent to him on his phone. It was my first time ever checking his phone. I had always trusted him wholeheartedly. She knew he was married. Everyone did. He lied at every single therapy session we went to prior to me finding out. However, I was going to forgive him, i wanted to keep our marriage. I didn't believe in divorcing because maybe, just maybe, he had only made a mistake. I knew it wouldn't be easy but I was willing to try. He stuck around for a bit, it was weird. We even continued counseling after the discovery day. He said he'd cut off all ties. 

 He finally decided that he was going to leave me. He had been planning it all along, feeding me full of lies. He really was just buying time to get his finances in order. Since that day in June, I have become the woman scorned. I have such strong feelings of wanting revenge on both of them.

,Divorce,"Everybody says journaling and/or writing is part of the healing process so here goes.

I had the bomb dropped on me by my STBXW a couple of days ago, I have been divorced before , but this time around I actually have so many emotions for her. No infidelity or anything, she just doesn't like my financial situation and doesn't want to be part of my recovery process anymore (I am recovering from bad decisions of the past, working towards financial freedom)

I thought this was the one, I thought we would grow old together, there were no red flags I can speak of, she was hot-headed, I am mellow and can handle anger, we seemed to complete each other.

I am in deep pain, and disappointment, I don't know what to do, I loved her so much (still do actually but hey, since when did love matter?) 

I am scared, scared of the divorce process, scared of meeting her again (I had to move to another country for work, she was supposed to follow me in 4 weeks), scared I will never be enough again for any woman, scared of the loneliness.

I kinda know from reading and watching videos what needs to be done, I think I am still in the denial phase of grief, her mom is still in touch with me hoping things could work out, I am not putting high hopes on any miracles, I have been through this before and I know how it feels.

I changed for her, for the better, I am taking better care of my health, I lost about 110lbs in 18 months, I am taking serious steps towards financial freedom, I only have one credit card to pay off and the remainder of an old car payments, I had to sell the car itself, now I need to pay it off. I have a stable job, except for my failing marriage, life seems to be progressing well.

I am also scared of my age, I am 37 but I don't feel my age at all, I feel like a teenager still trying to figure out which end of life is up, I am a late bloomer due to some difficulties in my childhood, I was homeschooled with abusive parents, it took me quite a while to integrate with society, my first marriage was a mistake by all means, I thought I was obliged to marry her since I was in a relationship with her, that didn't work, I thought this time around would work because I actually love her.

She always says during conversation how she is the person people can never get over or forget, so I intend to show her just how easy it is for me to get over this, I don't know if I'm in denial or anger right now, I don't feel resentment or spite towards her, the final breakdown was my fault and I intend to own it.

I am now in a very strict country from a societal perspective, I don't think I will meet someone new in the coming 5 to 7 years, I will be very lonely, but maybe working out and taking up hobbies is a good way.

I am completely lost, totally, utterly lost, it is 6am now and I don't even know how to sleep anymore, I haven't had anything to eat for 3 days now, this is the worst ride I had to endure.

I am very social by nature, meaning, I want to talk to someone, yet, I don't have the energy to go through a full conversation, I feel the silence is eating me from the inside, I trying talking to my mom, she is crying over my misery and it is making me even more miserable, I am smoking heavily hoping that the nicotine with dull everything, or kill me.

I have a history of suicidal tendencies, I don't think I'm suicidal now, but a big part of me wishes I would just go to sleep and never wake up.

Men are the a-holes? Ladies, you have no idea how much a man suffers when he is committed and has to lose everything.

I am so much in pain I don't even wish this upon anybody no matter who they are or what they did.

I am watching a rerun of LeMans 24, just getting mesmerized by cars going around the same track over and over for 24 hours, trying to lose myself.

I have work in a couple of hours and don't know how I am going to go there and manage my work, and a team of 10 people and a company that expects me to turn things around. by the way, I am good at what I do professionally, I guess we don't get everything right?

&lt;p&gt;My son who is 10, said that he too has slept in my Ex’s bed and also on the floor when the BF is visiting in the last 2 months. He said he doesn’t sleep very often like this, as he likes his own space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I do, if anything?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm in the process of divorcing my husband on 26 years. After him refusing to sign a separation agreement we finally were able to get that signed in court but we have one asset left to split and he refuses to sign for lowering the price of our house. 

He says he will not move out as he claims he has nowhere else to go. He has family within the city that are able to house him temporarily. He has taken half of my retirement savings as of Monday which is 200k. We have been to court several times over the house and now my lawyer has sent him a letter regarding lowering the house price but he still refuses. I need help, what can I do to get the house sold legally? 

This has been going on for a year and I just want to move forward with my life. Please send any tips or things I can do to work around him and get the house sold. We have just this house left to sell and then I am free of him. Any legal advice or tips for someone in Ontario, Canada.

,Divorce,"I'm using throwaway, cause reasons.

My english is not very good, since I'm from southeastern Europe and didn't really do my homeworks during tutorings.

&amp;#x200B;

I(now 30F) divorced my husband (now 31M) 17 months ago. We were married for two years, 3 years together, no kids. This may seem like a very short term, but in reality, we both assumed we wanted this.

After first year of marriage, I got very bored of our lifestyle. My ex-husband was handsome, nice, overly clever (no irony intended),  cared for me and made quite a sum through his own business, we went along very well and we considered ourselves life partners, not just people who are married. Yet, he clearly didn't like people in general - maybe he was even antisocial. And that was the ignition of fighting. He told me he has only two friends and it is good enough for him. He wasn't interested into meeting new people, and definitely wasn't interested in stuff like clubbing. 

He never spoke badly about mine friends group, but I could definitely feel he considered most of them low and stupid. Tbh, my friends group didn't really like him either - for many reasons, but mostly they were clearly envious of his money - we live in small town in an underdeveloped country, and they even hinted it (""how's Rothschild?"").   Cause I know for sure he never did anything wrong to them or something, he just wasn't interested in befriending them more.

Second year of our marriage, I got overwhelmed by routine - since I didn't work full hours - I was an artist - you know how that goes (I use my real reddit account for commissions, that's why throwaway). Every day was the same. For breakfast - we can go to have breakfast somewhere. Noon - let's get into car, drive somewhere, buy some stuff. Evening, get home, watch some tv series, or chill at our jacuzzi. Like hell, we even flew to some European metropole at least once per month, yet, it became so annoying, cause he wouldn't wanna try nightlife there. Some nice bar with few people inside - yes. Some club where we could have fun and meet some people - no way.

For example - we flew to Greece for a vacation once - of course he would book a luxurious villa on Santorini - there were like 20 people, mostly old rich couples, in the resort altogether. I asked him why would he do that - we will certainly have no fun around these folks. I told him I would love to go somewhere different next time, with young people around. He told me that this is the reason why he bothers making money - ability to avoid crowd of young people (vulgar and stupid - he didn't say that but he definitely meant it).

Don't get me wrong, I was really happy my husband could provide all that, I come from a rather poor family, and I would never experience rich man's world without him, I guess - I just wanted a normal life, also, like going out hiking with friends, clubbing and so on.

I tend to think I was a good wife to him. I really loved him. I tried to make him happy - and made me sure he is a happy person with me. Since his business could be very exhausting, I tried my best to make him stay calm - he could get extremely nervous instantly. I even let him do sexual stuff to me I wouldn't allow anyone else (anal sex was pretty softcore). My personal life went to zero, though. I missed clubbing and nightlife. Getting wasted was history for me, already, but still, I didn't want to spend my evenings watching TV or eating in restaurants. He wasn't fond of me clubbing. He was not really controlling type, but in such cases, he was like ""you're my wife, not my hypothetical 13yo daughter to argue about going or not going to dance club, you have no place there among those children there - if you think it is appropriate for a married woman of your age to go clubbing, that is some serious issue of yours, not mine.""

I started to feel resentment towards him, I felt like he doesn't care for my opinions, cause he's the clever one. I couldn't do this anymore, so I left his house, moved into my apartment and filed for a divorce. He made no protests at all, he was like ""Hopefully somebody else will make you happy, then."" There were no kids involved nor money to divide, our law isn't like in America - you cannot really get rich just by divorcing a wealthy man, he left me car he bought for me (along clothing, jewels) and sent his men to renovate my apartment, which I inherited after my grandma. He was very calm (cold as fuck, though) during the process and wished me best luck after. I told him I hope we stay on good terms, he was ok with that. We managed to solve all necessities in few days after divorce.

I started enjoying freedom from very beginning. It felt like a breath of fresh air. Started dating very soon after, spent whole nights with my friends in clubs during weekends, got a job as a waitress which I enjoyed, taking part in many community things. I didn't think of my ex any bit, I eventually saw him taking a ride in his car or having a lunch in some restaurant, but didn't care for him.

Months after, reality started to hit me hard. I started to realize many things were different than I saw them before. What hit me hard was one of my girl friend, who was very eager to support me to divorce ""this controlling freak"" actually started hitting on him once I left his house. I felt really betrayed and foolish. I started to struggle financially, so I had to sell my X6 and bought an old Peugeot. None of the guys I hooked up with was really a material for a relationship. I got fed up with going out drinking. Yet, I considered my ex a history. 

Everything changed half a year ago, when we met by coincidence in a Tobacco shop - when he saw me there, he turned around and tried to leave to buy his cigarettes somewhere else, but I called for him, like ""nice to see you, how are you... heh""

It seemed easier to invite him for a cup of coffee immediately than stay any more second in this weird conversation, so we went for one. After a couple of minutes, we started to be very comfortable around each other and had our portion of fun, he told me he's single, which put me in dangerous expectations, but I didn't care for that the minute, I enjoyed his dark pretty eyebrows jolly jumping while laughing.  It was like the old times, before we were married. After we've finished our coffees, I told him I had fun and hope we could go for a coffee some day again. His face went from happy to sad and told me ""Sure. Some day. See you then."" Anxiety started to flow through my body, so I proposed, with squeaking, half-strangled voice ""Maybe we could meet next week...?"" Situation was clearly uncomfortable for him, he told me: ""Well I have a lot of work going on lately, how about I call you once I have some free time?""

I knew immediately what was going on - there will be not another meeting over cup of coffee. He isn't interested in seeing me nor talking to me - I am clearly nobody to him, he moved on. Struck me really hard. I had my legitimate reasons to divorce him, but I definitely didn't want this. I cried my whole ride home and got ticket for speeding.

After this, my life went downhill. I cannot stop thinking about him - and I really regret divorcing him, even if for legitimate reasons. He was happy to make me happy and I was happy to make him happy. Everything is so different now. Any difficult issue I have drives me crazy, cause there is no one to tell me ""Stop it immediately woman, what did you get your husband for, I'm here to take care of everything you need.""

Recently, my father started to be emotionally abusive towards me again, and I have no husband to have my back. I cannot sleep per night, cause either I'm dreaming that we are together, and when I wake up during night into reality, I cry myself into sleep again. Otherwise, I have nightmares where he does sex stuff he did to me to another woman and I have to watch it, while he tells me she is much better than I ever was, or nightmares where he tells me that he hates me. I have to overdose on Clonazepam lately to get some sleep, otherwise I am unable to work next day.

Seeing him somewhere in town center I go immediately out, cause it causes me anxiety. Even seeing his car somewhere makes me feel nauseous. I don't know what to do. I cannot get some therapy, cause I cannot afford a private one, and therapy on Uni Healthcare is shit - they just give me Clonazepam.

I have strong urges to try to contact him, and I don't even know what for. Minute later, I get overwhelmed by anxiety while thinking about contacting him. I don't know what to do anymore. Nobody really helps me. I told my mother about feelings of mine - and she told me that is just an outcome of my own actions, and anyway, time will heal it. Everyone tells me time will heal it, but I want to know what to do now.

Tbh, my friends group didn&amp;#39;t really like him either - for many reasons, but mostly they were clearly envious of his money - we live in small town in an underdeveloped country, and they even hinted it (&amp;quot;how&amp;#39;s Rothschild?&amp;quot;).   Cause I know for sure he never did anything wrong to them or something, he just wasn&amp;#39;t interested in befriending them more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second year of our marriage, I got overwhelmed by routine - since I didn&amp;#39;t work full hours - I was an artist - you know how that goes (I use my real reddit account for commissions, that&amp;#39;s why throwaway). Every day was the same. For breakfast - we can go to have breakfast somewhere. Noon - let&amp;#39;s get into car, drive somewhere, buy some stuff. Evening, get home, watch some tv series, or chill at our jacuzzi. Like hell, we even flew to some European metropole at least once per month, yet, it became so annoying, cause he wouldn&amp;#39;t wanna try nightlife there. Some nice bar with few people inside - yes. Some club where we could have fun and meet some people - no way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example - we flew to Greece for a vacation once - of course he would book a luxurious villa on Santorini - there were like 20 people, mostly old rich couples, in the resort altogether. I asked him why would he do that - we will certainly have no fun around these folks. I told him I would love to go somewhere different next time, with young people around. He told me that this is the reason why he bothers making money - ability to avoid crowd of young people (vulgar and stupid - he didn&amp;#39;t say that but he definitely meant it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I was really happy my husband could provide all that, I come from a rather poor family, and I would never experience rich man&amp;#39;s world without him, I guess - I just wanted a normal life, also, like going out hiking with friends, clubbing and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to think I was a good wife to him. I really loved him. I tried to make him happy - and made me sure he is a happy person with me. Since his business could be very exhausting, I tried my best to make him stay calm - he could get extremely nervous instantly. I even let him do sexual stuff to me I wouldn&amp;#39;t allow anyone else (anal sex was pretty softcore). My personal life went to zero, though. I missed clubbing and nightlife. Getting wasted was history for me, already, but still, I didn&amp;#39;t want to spend my evenings watching TV or eating in restaurants. He wasn&amp;#39;t fond of me clubbing. He was not really controlling type, but in such cases, he was like &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re my wife, not my hypothetical 13yo daughter to argue about going or not going to dance club, you have no place there among those children there - if you think it is appropriate for a married woman of your age to go clubbing, that is some serious issue of yours, not mine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to feel resentment towards him, I felt like he doesn&amp;#39;t care for my opinions, cause he&amp;#39;s the clever one. I couldn&amp;#39;t do this anymore, so I left his house, moved into my apartment and filed for a divorce. He made no protests at all, he was like &amp;quot;Hopefully somebody else will make you happy, then.&amp;quot; There were no kids involved nor money to divide, our law isn&amp;#39;t like in America - you cannot really get rich just by divorcing a wealthy man, he left me car he bought for me (along clothing, jewels) and sent his men to renovate my apartment, which I inherited after my grandma. He was very calm (cold as fuck, though) during the process and wished me best luck after. I told him I hope we stay on good terms, he was ok with that. We managed to solve all necessities in few days after divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started enjoying freedom from very beginning. It felt like a breath of fresh air. Started dating very soon after, spent whole nights with my friends in clubs during weekends, got a job as a waitress which I enjoyed, taking part in many community things. I didn&amp;#39;t think of my ex any bit, I eventually saw him taking a ride in his car or having a lunch in some restaurant, but didn&amp;#39;t care for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months after, reality started to hit me hard. I started to realize many things were different than I saw them before. What hit me hard was one of my girl friend, who was very eager to support me to divorce &amp;quot;this controlling freak&amp;quot; actually started hitting on him once I left his house. I felt really betrayed and foolish. I started to struggle financially, so I had to sell my X6 and bought an old Peugeot. None of the guys I hooked up with was really a material for a relationship. I got fed up with going out drinking. Yet, I considered my ex a history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything changed half a year ago, when we met by coincidence in a Tobacco shop - when he saw me there, he turned around and tried to leave to buy his cigarettes somewhere else, but I called for him, like &amp;quot;nice to see you, how are you... heh&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed easier to invite him for a cup of coffee immediately than stay any more second in this weird conversation, so we went for one. After a couple of minutes, we started to be very comfortable around each other and had our portion of fun, he told me he&amp;#39;s single, which put me in dangerous expectations, but I didn&amp;#39;t care for that the minute, I enjoyed his dark pretty eyebrows jolly jumping while laughing.  It was like the old times, before we were married. After we&amp;#39;ve finished our coffees, I told him I had fun and hope we could go for a coffee some day again. His face went from happy to sad and told me &amp;quot;Sure. Some day. See you then.&amp;quot; Anxiety started to flow through my body, so I proposed, with squeaking, half-strangled voice &amp;quot;Maybe we could meet next week...?&amp;quot; Situation was clearly uncomfortable for him, he told me: &amp;quot;Well I have a lot of work going on lately, how about I call you once I have some free time?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew immediately what was going on - there will be not another meeting over cup of coffee. He isn&amp;#39;t interested in seeing me nor talking to me - I am clearly nobody to him, he moved on. Struck me really hard. I had my legitimate reasons to divorce him, but I definitely didn&amp;#39;t want this. I cried my whole ride home and got ticket for speeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, my life went downhill. I cannot stop thinking about him - and I really regret divorcing him, even if for legitimate reasons. He was happy to make me happy and I was happy to make him happy. Everything is so different now. Any difficult issue I have drives me crazy, cause there is no one to tell me &amp;quot;Stop it immediately woman, what did you get your husband for, I&amp;#39;m here to take care of everything you need.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, my father started to be emotionally abusive towards me again, and I have no husband to have my back. I cannot sleep per night, cause either I&amp;#39;m dreaming that we are together, and when I wake up during night into reality, I cry myself into sleep again. Otherwise, I have nightmares where he does sex stuff he did to me to another woman and I have to watch it, while he tells me she is much better than I ever was, or nightmares where he tells me that he hates me. I have to overdose on Clonazepam lately to get some sleep, otherwise I am unable to work next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing him somewhere in town center I go immediately out, cause it causes me anxiety. Even seeing his car somewhere makes me feel nauseous. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I cannot get some therapy, cause I cannot afford a private one, and therapy on Uni Healthcare is shit - they just give me Clonazepam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have strong urges to try to contact him, and I don&amp;#39;t even know what for. Minute later, I get overwhelmed by anxiety while thinking about contacting him. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. Nobody really helps me. I told my mother about feelings of mine - and she told me that is just an outcome of my own actions, and anyway, time will heal it. Everyone tells me time will heal it, but I want to know what to do now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry that this is so long, and maybe shaky, but I wanted to write this.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"I worry that the narrative is changing. I am 8 weeks out from my husband deciding that his future looks brighter without me. After 15 years, he said the words, ""I want a divorce"" and after he refused counseling, refused a separation and refused everything I asked to help find the spark he claims was lost forever, I gave him that divorce. I can't put all of my effort into fighting for someone that doesn't want me. I decided to shift my focus onto getting myself settled into a new place and start rebuilding my broken heart. 

I miss him terribly. I don't think a day has gone by that I have not cried - sobbed actually is a more accurate word.

I can't say I wish him well, but I can 100% say that I wish him no ill will or pain. 

Yesterday, I spent the evening with friends that I love and adore. Through simple conversation, I learned that the narrative has shifted on his end. As he walked away, he promised that everyone would know that this was his decision and that I did not want this divorce. That narrative has now shifted to one that focuses on how our marriage was miserable and it has been implied to many of our friends that the divorce was a mutual decision. 

This breaks my heart. I fought for our marriage. I so wanted to be with him forever. My vows meant everything to me, that promise I made was more than words . He has now implied that it meant as little to me as it did to him. 

He has said some hurtful things throughout this process. Beginning with ""I feel as though I settled for you our whole lives"" to ""I don't find you attractive"" and ending with ""I can see my future happiness without you."" My heart is broken and now, to have even one person believe that it isn't, just digs that knife in deeper. 

There is no solving this. He is still walking away. He has still filed. I can't confront him. I can't reach out to every friend to share my story. I feel like I have lost everything and am so grateful for the friends that continue to stick by my side and understand how hard these past two months have been.

,Divorce,"First of all, thank you to the mods/creators of this thread and members who take their personal time to read about and help others.

I'm a 32 y/o man and have been married to my wife since 2015. We met in 2012. It's ""only"" been 7 years since we met but what's happened during that time is a long and complicated story. I'll try to be efficient about it.

I met her online and we spoke for a while before meeting. When we did, it clicked. She was so opposite of my ex before her, and is what was so alluring I think. She was over my apartment on a daily basis, essentially ""moving in"" within just a few weeks of dating. In hindsight, that probably wasn't a great idea.

I found out a week later that she comes from a wealthy family; she's an only child to boot. They wanted us out of my cheap city apartment and into a house they had bought. It's in her father's name and we pay a cheap rent to them.

From some time during 2016 to March 2019, we had lived at her parents because my wife had a long, confusing, and complicated health scare that put us at the Mayo Clinic twice and Johns Hopkins once, and we stayed at each for 2 weeks, to an entire month straight. During that time, I lost all my private clients, and had to go on unemployment, alongside a deep state of depression; all while living with her parents who did not make it any easier, other than for finances. Instead of taking care of myself I would spend hours fighting with insurance companies, doctors, and researching/fact checking conflicting information from said doctors.

Their ""helicopter"" parenting made it even more stressful and hard to be motivated to do anything. It ended with a blowout with her father, during the time we were both beginning to regain our independence. So it went rather unresolved as we moved back into the house. We're on neutral terms. If he knew I were writing this now, that would certainly change!

She's always had issues with emotional dependency and anxiety, but it got worse over time. Even now that she's working (about 3-4 hours per day), I feel like I'm being emotionally ""extracted"" from, if that makes any sense. It doesn't feel like two strong, independent people coming together, but rather she needs me to exist in order for her to be happy. As a result she putters around the house if I'm not alongside her, she is super needy with hugging and attention. It's draining and a complete turnoff. Socially she's not strong and it further pulls us apart because I've given up being a mute with her just so she doesn't feel self conscious. We've discussed this before and she says she tries but it's just who she is. She's afraid since I'm so social women will see that and that makes her sad - she's admitted as much.

 We've certainly grown apart; at least, I have. She's incredibly nice and sweet but her presence is not exciting or interesting or gets me motivated to do anything. Her not being a bad person, and chronically ill, makes this more difficult for sure. In fact I truly believe her pain levels were directly correlated to to my mood and how I was feeling. I'm so drained by her depressing aura. I can't even find the time to sit here and type this without her butting into what I could possibly be doing without her right next to me.

Anyway, I'm using this time - yet another ""let's work on it"" effort - to figure out how to get out of this while ensuring I can get back on my feet. It sounds awful but I'm in survival mode and need time to prepare myself. There was no pre-nup; the house is not in our name; I believe I don't have rights to anything. That's fine. I'm not looking for a million dollars. I just want to know what my rights are and see if I can get something to recoup the time and clients I lost caring for my wife - in which her retired father did NOTHING to help by the way.

Hypothetically if I mentioned divorce today, she would tell her mommy and daddy, I'd be told to leave, wouldn't be able to afford even a crud apartment near my job, which I love but is low-paying (I work in a school as a special education para in a district in which I have made a ton of contacts and want to go on to get my Masters in SPED to teach). I'm petrified at the idea of having to start all over in a county that pays their paras peanuts and doesn't appreciate them. Here I  feel useful, appreciated, and see opportunities to move up efficiently barring educational/license requirements. I just want to afford a decent place from a decent distance to work. Something to get me back on my feet. She'll have everything she needs to keep herself afloat, but for me, I'm afraid not.

We live in CT. Not sure if there's a clause that will keep me from being booted out of this part of the state and left with nothing. Due to living here I've gotten settled in this area from a professional standpoint and would like to keep that; I also work some part time jobs paid for by people who would have to live in this area in order to afford it (tutoring, lessons, etc).

 Guess that's what speaking to a lawyer would help with, although I'm afraid to start having to pay for one when I'm already broke.

Ask about anything I may have forgotten to mention.

,Divorce,"So, I joined Reddit not too long ago because I discovered subs like this where I could find others in a similar situation, dealing with the same pain I am dealing with. I have read a lot of the stories here, commented on some, but this is my first post.

Something I have noticed is that A LOT of folks who have divorced come to the conclusion that they are much happier now. They are either glad they left their spouse (makes sense if you're the one that wanted to leave), or they are glad their spouse left.

Is there anyone out there who regrets it? Or who has rebuilt their life, is happy, but doesn't agree that divorce was the best or only option for their relationship?

I'm not trying to dwell on negativity, but it would help me to see others who feel this way. Seeing so many people ultimately happy with life after divorce feels very isolating to me.

A couple years ago, my husband left me out of the blue for my best friend. We had what I would characterize as a rough couple of months. I tried talking to him about what was going on, but he wouldn't talk to me. Of course, I assumed we'd get through it. We did not. He left and is still with my former friend. We are still in the process of divorcing, and we only communicate through our lawyers now.

He has placed all the blame on me going so far as to say that I abused him our entire relationship. This is absolutely false. I worried for so long that he was right, that I was an abusive monster, but after sharing his own words on the subject with my therapist, showing her his examples of my abuse, etc, I am confident he is full of shit. He has created an image of our marriage that I do not recognize. He has twisted and rewritten history. My former friend has helped him create lies about me.

There is nothing on this earth that would persuade me to go back to him were that option ever offered (it will not be, I know him). I do not like the person he has become, and I still carry a lot of anger and pain from the double betrayal.

But! Still! I feel deep in my bones that our marriage did not have to end this way. Had he given us more time, had he actually talked to me about what was going on, had he agreed to therapy.

We had a good relationship. We were a great fit for each other. We loved and supported each other. The issues he initially claimed we had (before he began telling people I abused him) were pretty standard communication issues that are, according to numerous therapists I've talked to about it (I know a lot of therapists, I don't just jump from therapist to therapist), are easily dealt with in therapy.

I don't want the relationship back, I am happy in my life now, I am in a good place, but I also know that had he not chosen literally the worst options for dealing with whatever he was dealing with, we could still be happy. We could have worked on those issues, solved the problems, and become stronger as a couple.

I have read a lot of the stories here, commented on some, but this is my first post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I have noticed is that A LOT of folks who have divorced come to the conclusion that they are much happier now. They are either glad they left their spouse (makes sense if you&amp;#39;re the one that wanted to leave), or they are glad their spouse left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anyone out there who regrets it? Or who has rebuilt their life, is happy, but doesn&amp;#39;t agree that divorce was the best or only option for their relationship?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not trying to dwell on negativity, but it would help me to see others who feel this way. Seeing so many people ultimately happy with life after divorce feels very isolating to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago, my husband left me out of the blue for my best friend. We had what I would characterize as a rough couple of months. I tried talking to him about what was going on, but he wouldn&amp;#39;t talk to me. Of course, I assumed we&amp;#39;d get through it. We did not. He left and is still with my former friend. We are still in the process of divorcing, and we only communicate through our lawyers now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has placed all the blame on me going so far as to say that I abused him our entire relationship. This is absolutely false. I worried for so long that he was right, that I was an abusive monster, but after sharing his own words on the subject with my therapist, showing her his examples of my abuse, etc, I am confident he is full of shit. He has created an image of our marriage that I do not recognize. He has twisted and rewritten history. My former friend has helped him create lies about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing on this earth that would persuade me to go back to him were that option ever offered (it will not be, I know him). I do not like the person he has become, and I still carry a lot of anger and pain from the double betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But! Still! I feel deep in my bones that our marriage did not have to end this way. Had he given us more time, had he actually talked to me about what was going on, had he agreed to therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a good relationship. We were a great fit for each other. We loved and supported each other. The issues he initially claimed we had (before he began telling people I abused him) were pretty standard communication issues that are, according to numerous therapists I&amp;#39;ve talked to about it (I know a lot of therapists, I don&amp;#39;t just jump from therapist to therapist), are easily dealt with in therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want the relationship back, I am happy in my life now, I am in a good place, but I also know that had he not chosen literally the worst options for dealing with whatever he was dealing with, we could still be happy. We could have worked on those issues, solved the problems, and become stronger as a couple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I also know that he purposely chose to encourage his feelings for my friend and chose to distance himself from me to justify it, so what do I know. Perhaps we were doomed from the start and nothing could have changed that.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"I guess I’ll start at the beginning and try to be as unbiased in my story as can be. I see comments how this community makes people feel better and helps those in need through difficult times. I’m hoping for a little of the same.

My wife &amp; I have been married for 9+ years &amp; have 3 beautiful children (7,5,4). About a year ago I found out that my wife was smoking weed during her lunch breaks (7th grade teacher). I was obviously furious because of the ramifications that could happen to our family if she got caught. This revelation led to MANY arguments and took us down a very dark path in our relationship. I would play detective and try to find out if she was doing it during lunch and this led to more arguments and days of silent treatment would ensue. I was accused of being controlling and making her feel like a prisoner in her own house. Through some more snooping, I found out that she was becoming friends with her drug dealer. But at the time I had bigger issues to worry about then who she was friends with.

Months went by of her getting high during the day, me finding out, arguing, silent treatment by me, contrition from her, with the occasional admitting from her that she has a problem and wants to quit, and a few failed attempts to quit.

Fast forward to the summer and school being out. The weed smoking continued at all times with the assistance of a vape pen. She also started drinking heavily almost every day, claiming, “it’s the summer, I’m just relaxing.” I would try to tell her that the drinking was getting out of hand, and that her family has a strong history of addiction, but I would be accused of being controlling again. Which led to more arguments.

Fast forward to the new school year. Getting high at lunch continued, as well as the heavy drinking TH-Sun. I told her I’m giving up trying to convince her that what she was doing was wrong because I was never going to change her mind and I felt like it was turning me into a bad person. So I turned a blind eye to what was going on and prayed she didn’t get caught.

About a week ago we had a huge blowup about her issues and my controlling habits. We yelled at each other and basically said we were done. She went to a friend’s house Fri. night and stayed over. Came home Sat. morning and said she wants a divorce. I said fine. We played nice for our kids, then she goes out again Sat. night and stays out all night. Comes home Sun. morning and says she wants to work it out for the kids and get back to being the old us. I agree because the thought of divorce and being away from my children for an extended period of time is heart breaking and terrifying to me.

The week goes really well. We both seem to be making an effort in our marriage. Then Thursday morning comes. Dun Dun Dunnnnn!!! The climax of the story! I find out that she’s been cheating on me with the shady drug dealer friend! I couldn’t be around her that night so I went to a friend’s house, came home around midnight and she is beyond drunk/high. Argument ensues and I end up calling 911 because she got physical. Cops come, she verbally abuses them, throws framed photos out of our bedroom window, and basically goes crazy. The police tell me to take my kids to my uncle’s house for the night because none of us were safe there. I go see lawyers the next day, shady drug dealer friend comes into my house to help clean up the mess and kiss my wife and a whirlwind day starts of me trying to keep the kids away from her while she was in the mental state she was in.  When it seemed that she was calm I relented and brought the kids home to see their mother. While there for a few hours she told me she blocked shady drug dealer’s #, dumped all alcohol out, made appoint with psych because she thinks she’s bipolar (she currently has a depression &amp; anxiety diagnosis) and apologizes for the mess she’s caused. Still hasn’t thrown out vape pen and weed cartridges though. She admitted to hooking up with shady drug dealer friend, but insists they only kissed on 4 occasions within the past few weeks. Says it’s rock bottom for her. But she also is still blaming me somewhat. Asking me if I think I’m innocent in all this, claiming emotional abuse for the days of silent treatment over the past year. I told her that’s because she would screw up and I would get angry. She would be too coward to fess up and apologize, so that’s what led to silent treatment. Her not speaking to me either is emotional abuse then. Ughhhh!!!!

,Divorce,"Hey everyone, 

26 year old male, married by wife at 22. Young. After college. At different colleges. 90% of our relationship was long distance. I followed the script that christian guys were supposed to. You find a nice lady, you do well in school and you career, get married, buy a house, etc. There was so much pressure from family and friends to get engaged as soon as we were in the same city after college. I thought I had what would keep me satisfied and fulfilled. But man, there were red flags. I guess there was an aspect of the relationship that was missing. Like a friendship aspect. We never seemed that emotionally connected. Since it was mostly long distance, the weekends together were packed full of everything and seemed great. Being in the same place I started to realize there was something wrong, but it just felt too late I guess? The expectation was there and I followed through with it thinking everything would work out. Hindsight is 20/20. 

Well, time went on, and I guess I was never truly happy. I figured I could make it work though with time and effort. We bought a house. I went to med school, did well, she did well in her field but something was missing. The whole time. Fast forward 3 years. The feelings built and built. I just felt incompatible. We were partners, not friends. We were successful, and from the outside looking in thriving, but I was so completely unfulfilled. The thought of leaving first popped into my head one year ago. But it was just an impossibility. The thought of hurting someone who hadnt done anything blatantly wrong gave me guilt that I couldnt handle.Time kept ticking. I lived with the fear that I would wake up in 40 years with a partner that I didn't really love, and that I would have regret my entire life. That ate away at me, constantly.

Ultimately, I got the courage to speak up last March. I wrote out my thoughts and read them out loud to her. She was blindsided. At the time I expressed my interest in making it work. I was hurting, and unhappy, but we could make it work. We started couples therapy, I went to individual therapy. For months. Nothing was changing. It wasn't like there was some concrete thing I could ask her to change. I just didn't feel the relationship was right. We got stuck in an unsustainable place. I withdrew. I didn't have it in me to give my all anymore. I felt like I had for years, trying to make it work. She was hurting as I was distant. I was wrought with guilt. She didnt deserve this. Ultimately, whether I knew what I was doing 4 years ago or not, I am the one who proposed and got us into the mess we were in. It wore us both out. I prayed to die in my sleep every night. 

Last week we went to a couples therapy session, this time with the counselor I had been seeing on an individual basis. Per his recommendation, I got up the courage to ask to separate. I had been afraid to do so out of the fear that I would hurt her, and out of the fear that I would disappoint my family. The realization that staying was doing more damage to everyone became real enough that I gained the strength to state I was going to go. So I did. We cried, she understood. There was an element of relief for both of us, I feel. 

We aren't pursing any legal changes yet. Theres a part of her that hopes I go out and realize that leaving isn't actually what I want. I tried to convey that I was pursuing what I wanted, but I felt it wasn't unreasonable to separate without legal changes at this point. Who knows what will happen I guess, although I am fairly confident.

 Now I'm looking for apartments, opening up a new bank account, and starting fresh. I feel relieved, nervous, guilty, anxious, excited, scared, etc. I know people will look at me differently. I bailed on a commitment. I hurt an innocent person. Ultimately, I made the decision that I can live with. I know there is pain now, but I feel that there will be less in the long term this way.

,Divorce,"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting to this sub (and my first time posting to Reddit ever, in fact). I'm also fairly new to this whole divorce process. My spouse and I separated about two months ago and we are keeping it cool and civil for the most part. As one might expect, I have my good days and my bad days, with the bad days often being debilitating. The worst part about that is how the one person I could always turn to in times like these is the one who is causing all of this pain. Furthermore, he doesn't even want anything to do with my emotional needs anymore. My spouse is much more interested in building a fun new life separate and apart from me. We spend time together on occasion, and things seem good when we do. But he has just recently revealed to me that he only hangs out with me because he feels obligated to do so, and that he doesn't actually enjoy my company at all. In a way, it almost seems like he delights in twisting the knife. Oddly enough this only happens when I actually express how I'm feeling. If I lie and pretend everything's cool and that I don't care what he's up to, then he warms up to me. Naturally this is not a dynamic I appreciate when interacting with a spouse.

It feels sometimes like he's been replaced by a replicant of some kind. The person who promised to be by my side for life is gone, and in his place is some weird android who behaves like him in most ways, minus any semblance of love or affection. The scary part about that is how quickly it happened, like flipping a switch. One day he was a caring spouse who was in love with me, and the next he was saying he no longer wants me and never even loved me in the first place. When I think about that, it inevitably leads me to a sort of blame game where I think about what I did wrong, what he did wrong, what ""environmental factors"" like work played a role in all of this, which certainly doesn't help. He does love to blame me of course, citing an entire laundry list of faults I apparently possess. The one that feels like it's stuck in my throat is that he doesn't consider me to be his ""equal,"" which is rage-inducing for a variety of reasons. I'm willing to accept my part in the breakdown of our marriage, but that's a bridge too far for me.

In any case, regardless of who or what is to blame, this is happening and there is nothing I can do to stop it. Couples counseling seems only to serve to solidify his decision to leave (ironically, he was the one who chose to initiate that). When I try to make things pleasant and fun when we spend time together, he accuses me of putting on an act. When I try to communicate my feelings about the situation to him, he shuts down or turns into a jerk. It feels like he's piling rocks on me, and when I'm able to push enough off of myself to breathe, he just adds more. He could stop at any time; after all, piling a bunch of heavy rocks on someone is no easy task. But he just can't stop. He needs to do this to ""live his best life"". A life that doesn't include me.

Well, this was long and florid. If you made it this far, thank you for reading. It does feel cathartic to vent these feelings out there on an active forum like this. I'm mainly hoping to get some perspective and support from others who have been through a situation like this. Hopefully I'll eventually gain enough perspective to provide some support of my own.

The first two months were awesome. We got along great. Then my grandma died very suddenly and it sent me into a tailspin that I am just now getting out of. I ended up becoming very angry and manipulative and extremely depressed. We had a major car accident in June (he broke his tib/fib, car was totaled) and he has been out of work since. Ever since then we have been fighting a lot more. He pays the bills because I have gone through 3 jobs this year and am on my 4th. I want to help him out financially so bad. I plan on starting in November. At the beginning of September I ended up in the psych ward for a couple of days. Then, 2 weeks later we were having more and more fights. He ended up telling me that he was thinking about divorce and he left to his sister's, I downed some pills cause I wanted to die. I immediately regretted it, called 911 and ended up in the psych ward for another week. I just got out on Wednesday. He came to see me every night while I was in the hospital and I thought that things were getting better. I ended up reevaluating myself and deciding that I wanted to change. I want to stop lying, being manipulative, and getting upset over little things. He picked me up Wednesday morning and things were going great. I thought we were cool.

I feel like we shouldn't do this, that it is too rash, but I guess he had been thinking about it for about a month now. Today my doctor called me up and told me that I have Borderline Personality Disorder. He thinks that's why I had been acting the way I have been this past year. I start on meds at the end of the month.

&lt;li&gt;Fly home after training and she tells me I&amp;#39;m out by a week. Files the papers. I can only keep the german shephard which is all I want. She gets the house (her parents place so duh). the benz (in her name that I pay for), and everything in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I start drinkin heavily again at the new place, but still maintain my job and taking care of my baby (german shephard). She shits everywhere every day because we both are not used to such a small place. My dad and frnds come in and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TAKE HER AWAY. im missing her more than my ex-wife.&lt;/li&gt;

,Divorce,"So I am at a giant impasse in my marriage. I (29F) have been married for 5 years (together almost 10) to my husband (39M). I have one child (10F) from a previous relationship, and we have a child (4F) together.

I have recently come to the conclusion that we are totally sexually incompatible. Like when we were dating he would make the jokes about ""we started at the same time. It's not my fault you didn't finish"" Sure, I found it funny. Maybe even cute. I told myself I could live with our very one-sided sex life, because true love conquers all right? As the years have gone by, I am more and more contemplating ways to go back in time and shake sense into my obviously nieve 19 year old self. 

It has not become an issue of his quick to finish in sex. Oh no! That I can live with. That I can handle! It is seriously his lack of follow through in seeing I get mine in return. He assumes, once he gets his, we are done. If I ask for more, I am ""sex crazed"" and ""needy"". He will near demand I give him oral (while I was a SAHM when our daughter was born, he would joke that it was my ""weekly rent""), but he then refuses to return the favor. He says that the look of the female sex anatomy is ""gross"" and ""weird"" and he can't bring himself to do it. (Again the issue is not with his refusal exactly, it is with the obvious lack of the equality of the situation) Though in 10 years, I have gotten him to do it I think 3 times?! It is like sex exists to please him, and if I seek mine through other means like masterbation or lord forbid ask for an open marriage (which I did try and failed) I am the weird one with sex on the brain. 

We had a moment a week ago where I suggested mutual oral sex after going down on him as he liked. (I don't ""usually"" ask, but I was feeling rather in the mood for it and felt adventurous) It got me a ""no. maybe later"" when I asked why not then, he just shut down and went silent. I took it as the moment was over and got up to get dressed. He got up and grabbed his shoes and keys and stormed out. When I try to bring up the event as a means to ask ""what happened? What did I do wrong?"" He gets defensive and I can't ask about it. ""It's how I handle stress"" is all he will tell me. I can only think of it as a giant pink elephant that neither of us will acknowledge but obviously need to.

But the sex is only ONE piece of this giant falling jenga tower I think of as my marriage. 

My husband and I have had a bunch of changes in the past so many years. At his request, I quit the job we were in together when we met, he got a new job a day after our wedding,  I was a stay at home mom for a year when our daughter was born, &amp; I returned to the work force when he decided our finances needed us both working again. He works nights I work days in an office. 

My job is in a town 30 minutes away, and I started asking about moving so I could lessen my commute (with inner city driving taking kids to daycare/school and my job, I spend about 2 hours driving a day). About 4 months ago, he finally agreed on one condition. I qualify for the home on my own. He told me that he was quite sure I could NOT find a home that I would qualify for on my own. (Our home was bought by he and his mother prior to our marriage -though we were dating at the time-). But both of us make double (I now tripple) than what we made when said house was bought, so I could not see where his negativity came from. Well, no surprise to me, but one to him, I found a new home under construction only 5-10 minutes from my work with easy access to the highway so he could commute to his job in our current town and it fit in my pre-approval range for a mortgage on my own.

We sold the current home and made a decent profit, but he only deposited half the money into our account. He said he put the other half in an account seperate from our main account that was only listed under his name for his own piece of mind. Sure, the half he did deposit is more than enough for the minimal downpayment on the new house. I was really hoping to use more of the house equity to have a 20% down payment to drop PMI, but he refuses to touch the other half.

On an emotional level I have always been self conscious and he knows this. But he has always loves to make jokes about the way my body has changed after children (and he is no fit chicken either mind you!). Yet, when I try to do things to help my body image, he tells me I don't need them. Or my favorite was an exchange where he told me that if I got fit again then another man could sweep me off my feet and take me from him. But as long as I was ""fat"" (I am 5'8"" and 170lbs), no other man would want to love me and take me away from him. Between his jokes and the constant being alone due to our shift differences, I have struggled hard with depression and other mental issues. When I finally brought up the courage to tell him I was having issues and needed help, I was met with ""you're not depressed. Depressed people don't smile like you do."" That may have been my 'fuck it all!' moment...

Between this behavior and out most recent giant pink elephant mentioned earlier. I am seriously contemplating separation and possible divorce. But I have just been unsure about pulling the trigger. Like I am not sure if I were to ask for a seperation now, could he lock our account and then I do not have the downpayment? If I were to wait and do it after the home purchase, does he have claim to the new house even though the mortgage was secured under my name alone? Like I feel that timing is everything and I would have to do it the right way. (Another fear to filing against him is the fact that his family works on the court system, so I know he would get strings pulled for a better defense and possibly railroad me if it came to that).

So here I am blabbering like an idiot to reddit venting and wondering ""when the hell do I do now?!""

I'm making my own bank account next week and going to start putting my disability check into it. I have a job at walmart to start me off for now but i'm waiting for the orientation day. My only problem is here that the only car that we have is mine. My grandma paid for it in cash with my money but i had to put wifes name on it also. So now I don't have a car. I guess i can just uber to and from work but ugh. I've been staying at home with the kids for 4 years now. We haven't started the divorce process because we can't afford it so she said we are seperated until we can afford a divorce. I told her that before i move out I want a parenting plan with her but honestly i'm not even sure how to come up with one and she said we don't need one until we divorce. So i guess we're going to play it by ear? She said she would drop the kids off in the morning on the way to work.

All she does is constantly put me down. Saying i've done nothing over the past 4 years. I suppose she's right. All i did was take care of the kids, cook, clean, and do all the laundry. She went to work came home, sat on the couch with the baby and that was it. She has been constantly especially lately throwing it in my face that she would have loved to stay at home with the kids but she had to work to take care of the family because at the time that we had kids she was making more money then i ever would have. I should be happy that i get the luxury to stay at home with the kids. I am most days. I'm grateful to spend so much time with them.

Will she ever actually admit to doing anything wrong because as of right now she's telling all her family that it's me and i ruined our marriage and how terrible i am. She blames me for everything. Literally every single thing, She says i used her for years and i'm stupid if i think that i will stay in the same house as her while we are still married but seperated.

The last thing is she's pissed at me now because i'm seeing someone who is poly and married with a kid. I wouldn't open up our marriage because it wasn't stable, there was no trust, and no communication but now i have pissed her off to a whole new level by doing this because it was a ""slap"" in her face since i wouldn't do it with her.

,Divorce,"My wife left me for a student in her yoga class. I loved her very much and it has been very hard for me. We were married for 2 years, together for 9 years, and we bought a house together 5 years ago. 

She told me she was unhappy around March of this year. We went to therapy, and tried to work it out. She talked about wanting an open marriage but I found out that she really just wanted to be with this guy from her yoga class. I do not know if she actually cheated on me before she left or not. Honestly, I really don't care. 

She left when I was on a camping trip and took a bunch of our stuff. She came back again and took more when I was at work. She took the cat and dog and it tore me apart. So I texted her and told her that we need to discuss if she was going take anything else and that I changed the locks. I didn't really change the locks and told her that shortly after. But she used that with her lawyer to say that I evicted her so that she doesn't need to pay her share of the mortgage anymore. I have been working with my own lawyer. The whole thing has been going really slow. I made her a fair cash offer on the house and have been paying the entire mortgage in the 4 months I have been waiting for an answer. She finally got back to me after pushing my lawyer. She got her friend who is a realtor to say the house is $110,000 more than what we paid 5 years ago. I know the market has gone up, but that is a crazy price. I went ahead and agreed to sell, because she will never sell me the house for a fair price. 

I asked my lawyer to work on getting her to start paying her portion of the mortgage again. She is on the mortgage. I know that if we put it on the market for the price that she wants then it will not sell for a year or more. I also can not rent out a room when I'm selling it.  Also if she stands to make half of the profit off the house she needs to keep paying. I have done a lot of reading on this and believe I am in the right here.

The problem I am having is that my lawyer wrote me in an email that she will ask her lawyer about it but not to expect it because that is like asking her for rent. But it's not asking her for rent, it is asking her to pay for an investment that she signed a contract to pay. I wrote her back, and asked for an explanation. I don't want to have to find another lawyer but I feel this was bad legal advice.

Also if she stands to make half of the profit off the house she needs to keep paying. I have done a lot of reading on this and believe I am in the right here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I am having is that my lawyer wrote me in an email that she will ask her lawyer about it but not to expect it because that is like asking her for rent. But it&amp;#39;s not asking her for rent, it is asking her to pay for an investment that she signed a contract to pay. I wrote her back, and asked for an explanation. I don&amp;#39;t want to have to find another lawyer but I feel this was bad legal advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any experience on this topic? Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

Current situation:  my wife and I verbally separated 5 months ago but still live together for financial reasons.  I haven't started dating yet.  Why?  Who knows?  The thought of starting over again with someone else seems overwhelming in a sense.  I do want to find someone new, but I guess I'm not ready yet and my focus is on my kids and being the best dad I can be.  My STBX on the other hand just turned 40 and is living like she is 20.  She  barely spends time with the kids and is constantly on her phone sexting and meeting up with many different guys for sex.  Side note:  when I  caught her lying to me I started going through her phone and reading all these conversations. I found out she was cheating at least a year before our verbal agreement.  THAT really pissed me off.  Throughout our whole marriage I never invaded her privacy.   Always respected her. I did not recognize who this person was.  Saying and doing things she would never have thought of doing during our entire time together. Another side note:  she stopped being a wife, emotionally and physically about 2 years ago.  I knew divorce was on the horizon, but thought we could work through things and rediscover each other again.

Yesterday was our 11 year anniversary.  Granted shes been dating and sleeping with multiple men already, and decided it was perfectly fine to do that again on our anniversary.  I know our marriage is over, and maybe living together still really rubs it in my face and pours salt in the wound, but she obviously doesnt give a shit how I feel.  But the way she has been acting, especially last night has me feeling bitter and angry.  Maybe even jealous.  Not jealous of her, but jealous that she can move on so easily after everything we built together.  Like it meant nothing to her.  Why do I feel like this?

To add to the above comment about being jealous.  It came out wrong.

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what’s going to happen. I feel very much like I’m going to lose everything because I’m a man, the breadwinner and in california.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"“I haven’t felt fulfilled for the last year.” Those were his words. His excuse for leaving. His excuse for declining therapy and my request to look for ways to help him feel fulfilled.

I realize now that those words are full of so much disrespect for the relationship that we had, I missed it all when he said it. I was blinded with sadness.

With two people looking out for his happiness - myself and him - I forgot that I deserved someone looking out for mine as well.

How could I be surprised by this sudden desire to be divorced? It certainly couldn’t be that he continuously claimed that he loved me and felt we were an amazing couple and connecting on a whole new level over the past year. That we had come so far and were meant to be together.

His quest for this elusive happiness stole him from me. He had silently suffered next to me for what he claimed was a year, then (as he spoke to our friends) two years then somewhere between three to five. He claimed he felt as if he had settled for me our whole lives and that our 15 years together had left an empty hole in him, one that he needed to fill with adventure. He could see a future without me. One where he found passion and where the music that he loved and the festivals he chased could envelope him. A future that I most certainly am not part of because our marriage is the thing dragging him down. Yet, he ""still loves me. He just isn't in love with me any longer.""

The ethical ending to a lifelong partnership is offering the person you have claimed to love - even if just for a short time - something. Offer them a few weeks of counseling. The worst it could do is help you find a way to end things peacefully. Maybe a little understanding on each side. Instead, I am left feeling like a piece of garbage tossed casually into the bin. My entire past, the reality that I lived a complete lie and one not worth even an ounce of effort on his part to preserve.

As the title states this is the loneliest I have felt since I made the decision to be separated and honestly I feel like hot garbage and I have no one but myself to blame at this point. So the reason I even went out in the first place was because I was invited by a girl that I am actually really into, I know she isn't into me, but a little bit of me wishes she was. She then cancels the plans after I am already in town, which really bites, but I figured that I am already here so why not have fun while I'm in town. That feels like a big mistake, first off drinking by yourself is really fucking awkward, like really fucking awkward and makes me realize how fucking old I am. I may be only 28 years old, but everyone made me feel like I was a fucking dinosaur that shouldn't be out at this time of night. 

Everyone that you try to talk to at this point in the night has a certain hostility toward you, which makes sense since you are not part of the group, but man does it make you feel like shit when you are actually trying to have a conversation and another person in their group swoops in to ""save"" them from you. Its also not lost on me that I have been striking out as far as the dating scene goes, but damn does this make it so apparent why I haven't done so well. Every girl I tried to talk to tonight was so not into me, or had no interest in conversation at all. Which in retrospect I get that not everyone is looking to hookup while they are out on the town, but damn does it hurt your ego it be rejected so badly. Honestly the thing that hurt the most, I have been having a good week and I thought I was on top of the world, I thought that I would be able to get past this whole divorce pretty smoothly and that I would be able to move on. It's just little things that my mind kept noticing that I couldn't ignore that is kinda killing me now. While a band was playing I noticed that the girl in front of me was scratching her boyfriend's back, it reminded me of my ex, the way she would do so to let me know she was into me and in the mood. I couldn't help but notice the couples throughout the night and it was probably the reason I felt so down.

It wasn't the only couple thing that I noticed, but it was the one thing that made me think of how alone I really was. Tonight made me think I should just give up and just accept that I am going to be alone for a good long time and there is nothing that I can do about it. Just delete the tinder, just stop going out and just lay down and accept fate, maybe that is an ok thought, I don't know to be honest. I've always been the one with the answers in my relationship, now that I am in territory that I just don't understand I just feel like rolling up and dying at this point. I don't know what to do with myself and honestly with everything else that is happening with my life I feel like shit. Reality has finally caught up with me and has slapped me straight in the face. I am alone, I won't have a place to live in a month, my children are gone and happy without me, my family side with my abusive ex wife rather than me, I'm not attractive as I thought I was, and no one, but me is going to make this ok. granted that I even can make this ok or even recover from this.

I'm not really sure if I can make a recovery from this, hell I might even just delete this in the morning, but I just feel like crap and felt like getting it out. Honestly just rereading this just makes me feel like I am being petty, but shit I guess that's just my mood. I don't know what I am trying to get out of this, even if I want anything out of this. Guess I just needed to vent to people who have no context on my life, so here we are Reddit. Judge away if you please, let me know how much of a dip shit I am being, give me the slap down I probably deserve.

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t the only couple thing that I noticed, but it was the one thing that made me think of how alone I really was. Tonight made me think I should just give up and just accept that I am going to be alone for a good long time and there is nothing that I can do about it. Just delete the tinder, just stop going out and just lay down and accept fate, maybe that is an ok thought, I don&amp;#39;t know to be honest. I&amp;#39;ve always been the one with the answers in my relationship, now that I am in territory that I just don&amp;#39;t understand I just feel like rolling up and dying at this point. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do with myself and honestly with everything else that is happening with my life I feel like shit. Reality has finally caught up with me and has slapped me straight in the face. I am alone, I won&amp;#39;t have a place to live in a month, my children are gone and happy without me, my family side with my abusive ex wife rather than me, I&amp;#39;m not attractive as I thought I was, and no one, but me is going to make this ok. granted that I even can make this ok or even recover from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not really sure if I can make a recovery from this, hell I might even just delete this in the morning, but I just feel like crap and felt like getting it out. Honestly just rereading this just makes me feel like I am being petty, but shit I guess that&amp;#39;s just my mood. I don&amp;#39;t know what I am trying to get out of this, even if I want anything out of this. Guess I just needed to vent to people who have no context on my life, so here we are Reddit. Judge away if you please, let me know how much of a dip shit I am being, give me the slap down I probably deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also my best friend is moving out and it is really fucking with me.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"So sorry this is long - I really need some serious help.

Obligatory throwaway account - some backstory: We've been married 16 years (\[m\] 45, \[f\] 42), kids are \[m\] 10, \[f\] 12.  I went through some years of depression from 2002 through to 2017 (yeah) due to various tragedies in my life.  During that time, it ate away at our emotional connection, and instead of focusing on it, we instead focused on getting through the deaths of 3 close friends of mine (2002, 2005, and 2010), and the lengthy health issues an subsequent death of her father (65 yo Vietnam vet) in 2014.

During this time, I became isolated and despondent.  One of my biggest problems was that I wasn't dependable, so she had to compensate for me, which I know causes resentment.  This was in addition to being responsible for the kids and her dad, so I get why she would be that way.  The result was that she became very controlling over nearly every aspect of our kids' lives.

She cheated on me in 2017 on the day after our anniversary over the course of a couple months.  During that time, she brought the kids over to this person's (he was married) house more than a few times since he was a big LEGO enthusiast.  Right around that time, I suspected something was up, I got freaked, she told me that she was thinking of leaving me (but didn't admit to any cheating, I only had doubts, no evidence) due to my depression issues.  There's more backstory there - i.e. I had tried some meds to no avail, but this time with the threat of divorce, I knew I had to change.  So I did.  I immediately scheduled therapy, I started on meds, I started to socialize.  She said she ""wanted me to be healthy for my own sake"" (the irony is not lost on me here).

Now keep in mind, I never once abused her mentally or physically.  I never name-called.  At most, I might have been insensitive, but normally my argument style comes from logic, which...doesn't work so well.  But, she responded to this by shutting down emotionally over the years.

I compensated for these troubles by being pathetically submissive in what I allowed, because I felt that I didn't deserve anything better than what I had.  The odd thing?  I'm very confident at work; I am respected and people enjoy being around me, because I lift them up, I treat everyone the same, and people trust my decision-making skills.  When I come home, I feel like a second-class citizen.

Then I discovered evidence that she was cheating on me by way of me looking through text messages.  This was about 3 or four weeks after I had an epiphany about how I was affecting my family.  When asked if I hadn't found out, would she have told me - answer: ""No.""  For some stupid reason, I thought that I deserved to be cheated on after being the way I was for so long, so I wanted to work through it, become stronger, show the kids that as a family, we can work through problems, no matter how big.

Fast forward 2 years later.  We had tried marriage counseling.  While I thought we were making progress, she felt that it wasn't helpful.  It wasn't addressing the issues she wanted to bring up.  We stopped going.  Emotional contact went from little to non-existent.  While I would still do things for her - i.e. work on various projects at her job (she runs a nature school for 2/3 yo's), it didn't seem to have any affect on her feelings for me.  I felt like a roommate.  We started sleeping in different rooms.  Sex stopped.  Any time with the kids - is pretty much controlled.  She takes them to school (the school is in the same building as her job), takes them to appointments, etc.  I have pretty much 0% responsibility in that realm, but not by choice, because, well, those were our roles and it was practical to do it that way.  If I offer, I am met with, ""no, I got it,"" or ""don't worry, it's more convenient if I do it.""  As an aside, I'm not even allowed to bring the kids to my parents (they are 2 hours away), because my mom can be toxic at times.

As far as our roles were concerned, I was the fix-it, hang out with the kids and game, money-maker (I make a lot more than she does, I'm not bragging, but my goal was to provide what I was good at to the family) guy; good, moral stand-up father...etc.  She was responsible for the finances, getting kids to where they need to go, etc.  We filled those roles pretty well.

Now, realize that during this time, I have pretty much defeated my depression, I'm no longer under the constant shadow of darkness and gloom and a defeatist attitude.  I had a life-altering event that told me that I HAD to do something, or all would be lost.  It's amazing what a person can do when faced with something like that.

Recently, in an unusual fit of vitriolic anger, she declared to me that I was a terrible father, a terrible life partner, incompetent, that the kids would never choose to be with me,  that she would ensure that I would be in ""the periphery,"" and that ""I bring everyone down who's around me.""   I know none of these things to be true, but I also know that many of these comments stem from my lack of attention to the family when I was depressed until 2017.  Don't get me wrong, I was mostly functionally-depressed.  It was just that by the end of the day at work, my mental health bar went down to 10%.

I have shown in the past two years that I have been better, more responsible, I can remember things, etc.  I've come a long way - but she won't compromise on anything when it comes to taking on any responsibilities with the kids.  THIS WOMAN DOES NOT compromise.  She is ridiculously stubborn, so even if I were to offer some ideas for parenting - - if it doesn't sit well with her, it's a ""nope, not going to do that"" comment immediately.

I am now faced with the following:

She is filing for divorce.  She wants (i.e. it's IL, so she's entitled) maintenance due to my 'gainful employment' (I'm in IT, she is an educator), she wants majority parenting, she wants to keep the house for the stability of the kids.

I know that all this sounds pathetic, and it is.  I've just accepted my role thinking that hey, at least I was with someone who was responsible, and I could always depend on her to do the things that I'm not good at.  But now, I feel like I was gas-lit in that I have this belief that I'm not capable of being a better dad - I'm thinking it's simply that I've not been allowed the opportunity to be a better dad.  I'm scared shitless that my kids will be taken from me because my wife just ""does most of the stuff"" for them for their day-to-day things.  I mean, she is a good mom, but it appears she doesn't even respect the role of 'dad' in our kids' lives.

Note: She's a single child of divorced parents (they divorced in her early 20's, she's 42 now).  Dad was always irresponsible and ended up cheating on her mom...maybe there's something there.

I have a therapist and an attorney (as does she), so I'm good there.  I'm documenting all of our interactions if it involves anything other than transactional stuff.

Have any of you gone through this, and what can I do to help my situation when it comes to parenting rights?  I want 50/50 or close to it as possible, but I'm frightened that she will use my prior depression and  lack of prior responsibilities or our current roles (assumed/forced) against me.  She says that I should do what's in the ""best interest of the kids.""  I consider that as ""they should have as much time with each parent as possible.""

I am willing to do whatever it takes to be with my kids as much as possible and do all the things that need to be done to be a good dad, but I've been steamrolled for so long, I am scared.  At the end of it all, I feel like a loser that I let this happen and I can only blame myself.  This SUCKS.

TL;DR: Married with kids, controlling wife cheated on me after some years of depression on my part.  I pretty much defeated my disease, became a much more responsible person, not allowed to have additional responsibilities, now wife wants divorce w/maintenance/majority parenting time/marital house, etc.  Advice on how to ensure I get most parenting time with kids as possible in IL.

,Divorce,"Well, my husband wants a divorce. I didn’t get married until my mid 30s and figured one and done. There’s exactly one divorce in my entire extended family for four generations at a minimum.  I did it once and did it right. 

Wrong. 

So first, about me/us: I’m 44F, he’s 43M and we have a 5-year-old son. (My heart shatters into pieces for him.) We’ve been together a little over 10 years and married for 8. We own a house that we just moved into 2 months ago. 

We have struggled for a long time because, as it turns out, we are very different people. He claims all sorts of things and has said I would have to change 100% and he’s done nothing wrong (which is absolutely not true). He has a story in his head that I’m never going to change. He holds onto things from the past and has no healthy marriage close to him to have learned from. (His dad died when he was little and his mom remarried when he was in high school but stepdad really didn’t want much to do with them. His sibling’s marriage consists of one of them staying home with the kids and the other working a union, mediocre-paying job, coming home and sitting on the couch, then going to bed early. I don’t see them share the load.) 

This is probably for the best, but I’m just in shock and don’t know what to do. No one cheated or hit anyone or drank too much or anything like that. But I’m a Christian (raised Catholic, currently attending non-denominational) and I made a promise before God. How can I break that? I’m embarrassed and humiliated and heartbroken. 

My family doesn’t know yet, but they will soon. I hated  the empty feeling after breakups when I was dating; I don’t even know how hard this is going to be to get over. I don’t want to think about dating but I don’t want to think about being alone. I don’t know how my son will react or how to make sure he gets through this okay.

,Divorce,"We've been married around 7 years and have 2 young kids. Both in the late 30s. I haven't brought up divorce to her yet, but we've been unhappy together for years. We barely communicate, and when we do it's usually going to be an argument. We don't have sex, and it's been that way for a while too. We still share a bed, in which we both face away from each other and generally avoid contact, but half the time I'm being kicked out of it to sleep in one of the kid's rooms. She hates that I snore. We generally have disagreements on almost everything. At this point when she tries to argue with me, I just laugh because I'm worn down from the constant fighting. She argues with me in front of my kids and if I try to argue back or defend myself it becomes, ""Not in front of the kids."" I'm very finished with this marriage and am ready to get out, however:

I absolutely love my children and they are the world to me. If it weren't for them, I'd have left a long time ago. She makes around 100-110k a year and I make 50-60. We share a large house that I've fixed up and put a lot of work into maintaining. We split all of the bills 50/50, and we also both work full-time. The house is in my name, and I would be signing it over to her - I'll find a smaller house or a condo to live in. The mortgage is around the 1500\~ mark and with her salary she would be able to afford it comfortably. Kids go to daycare and school when we're not home. She's got a 9-5 and I have a more irregular schedule, but it works well. When I tried to see exactly how much time we each spend with our kids, it truly is 50/50. I see them for half the week, and then she sees them for half the week. So when we divorce, hopefully it would be the same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I'm scared she could file for full custody and win. I don't want alimony from her, I don't want anything from her. I'm just scared of the process and of losing my kids. We're miserable together and neither of us have fully mentioned divorce to each other, but I believe she knows as well as I do that we're only together for the kids right now. She seems to be even more unhappy than I am so I'm confused as to why she hasn't made the first move on it, aside from being scared of the same thing I am.

,Divorce,"Hello all. I wished to share my experience after 2 months of divorce. I am 37 male and my STBX is 42 female. We have 2 children ages 6 and 12. We were together for over 15 years and legally married just under 2 years.

**TLDR:** My wife admitted she wants a divorce. After all the work I have put into myself the last 2 months, I am extremely happy and empowered on a personal level. I have never loved myself more than I do right now. I don't know what the future holds, but I am just happy to be enjoying the ride. Don't lose yourself in the situation. You have the power to make your life amazing if you chose to.


My wife realized in June that everything in her life was wrong. She was not happy living in South Florida, hated the weather, hated the people, had no more friends, did not want to work here anymore, and was tired of settling for her situations. She is having an identity crisis and could not figure out who she was, but that she must move back to Maine. She also decided that I was no longer good for her or the children. For the past year and 3 months, she did not have to work because our financial situation improved enough that her having a job was optional. During that time to think, she realized she had not known herself since middle school when she was forced to move and has been going through life because she must, but not how she wants. However, she did not tell me any of this right away.

During July up to August, I started to go through my own change. I felt the distance between us, but ultimately I was devastated when I found out. I guess on a subconscious level, I feared she was unhappy with our relationship. Through my personal change, I realized how happy and content I was for the previous year. I had achieved personal fulfillment. I had a great job, good money, no debt, a house, a family, and money for vacations/repairs, etc. I couldn't ask for more of my out of my life. I knew that I wanted to help my wife find that fulfillment. I could tell she was a little lost, but I never understood how much. I wanted to dedicate myself to helping her find that fulfillment in life that I felt. I fully realized this at the end of July when the wife and kids went to Maine for 6 days for a funeral for an uncle. I stayed home to take care of our cats and her mother's cats. While they were away, I realized how much I missed them and wanted to be more dedicated to the family on a physical level. I wasn't the best husband or father and knew where I wanted to improve, but I also wasn't terrible either. I was a great provider and repaired the home/cars as things broke. I wasn't good at communication. I was very passive in parts of the relationship. I let my wife do most activities with the children because she didn't ask me for help. If someone was not asking me to do something, I would just go find something to occupy my time (usually PC gaming or podcasts). At some point in the marriage, I stopped making an effort to spend extra time with my wife. She would make an excuse why we couldn't go out on date because she didn't trust anyone with the children. My wife also stopped making that effort with me. Her will to communicate was worn down. She chose the same communication method for 15 years expecting different results. We never sought out professional counseling for ourselves. During the times I would get frustrated, I would yell or talk loudly. My wife hated that and so do my children. I never realized how much it bothered them. My wife did try to talk to me about it, but I brushed it off as no big deal. Part of that was because that was how I grew up and the only way I knew how to be a parent. However, my 12-year-old son was very hurt by it. Most of this I realized over the next 2 months and not during the marriage.

When they returned from their trip, I decided to share all my thoughts and feelings with my wife. Her first response was, ""Wow. I can't believe what I am hearing. I need time to think about that."" I had no expectation of how she would react and figured she would need time to think about it. That next week, I started to go about my new behavior, but I noticed my wife was still physically and emotionally distant from me. After 6 days, things did not feel right and something told me to ask her if she wanted a divorce. She admitted that she is done with the relationship, but was afraid to say anything and wasn't sure when she was going to tell me. She admitted that she has felt this way since June. I was completely devastated. My worst nightmare was true and I didn't know what to do or if it could be saved. She wanted to get a divorce and move the next summer after the school year was over. If possible, she wanted to live together in the same house for the rest of the school year. She said she did not want to go to couples counseling either. I was not happy, but I felt there was no changing her mind. I agreed with this. I wanted to enjoy as much time with the children as possible before they moved away.

The 2nd day I realized I was getting a divorce, I sat down with my son and talked. I told him sorry if I hurt him. I asked him if hated me and he said no. I told him I would miss them very much when they moved, but I was happy to spend the next school year with them. In the last 2 months, our relationship is stronger than ever. I will continue to strengthen our bond.

Over the last 2 months, I talked with my parents, her mother, several co-workers, friends, family, etc. I would talk to anyone who would listen because it was extremely therapeutic. I took in all the advice and input that anyone would give me. I made an appointment to see a counselor for myself. I realized I had the ability to write out my thoughts better than speak, so I started keeping a journal. By the end of the first week, I wrote my wife 2 letters. The first was about understanding and acceptance of the divorce. The 2nd was a plea to let’s give us 1 more try. She still wants a divorce. I wrote a letter to her sister and mother explaining my thoughts and feelings on the divorce. I've written a letter to my co-workers thanking them for their support. I wrote a letter to my siblings about where the source of my anger comes from and how I know how to prevent it. I have shared all my writings with my counselor and she encourages me to continue writing. I started going to bed early and waking up early. I go on morning walks for 30 minutes on most days. I joined an exercise class once a week. I eat less and healthier now. I have lost 25 lbs. and will continue to lose more. I continue to enjoy my counselor meetings once a week. I am a much happier and positive person than I could ever remember being. I like the way I handle my frustrations and conflict resolutions, especially with my children.

As far as our current situation, we are living together very peacefully. We have met with a mediator and are almost through will all the paperwork for divorce. The current agreement is I pay child support and give half my 401k to her, and she will get to move out of state. We are time-sharing the children 80/20 since I live so far away. If I move to Maine, I can get closer to 50/50 custody. We are still friends. We do not hug or have any sexual contact. The time spent at home is very comfortable for the children. They are both aware of the divorce and know that they will move in the summer. She has made no attempts to reconcile the relationship. At this point, I don't think I would want to. I understand that it is difficult to look at what someone is and not what they were when you spent so much time with them. I do not fault her for this, but it would make trying a second time more difficult.

I am happy with who I have become since the realization of divorce. I love myself for putting all this work into improvement and I want to continue my growth. If I had 2nd chance at marriage with her, I would put the same effort into it with profession help. She is too hurt and resentful to try again. I hope that she eventually gets counseling for herself to heal and improve herself.

&lt;p&gt;When they returned from their trip, I decided to share all my thoughts and feelings with my wife. Her first response was, &amp;quot;Wow. I can&amp;#39;t believe what I am hearing. I need time to think about that.&amp;quot; I had no expectation of how she would react and figured she would need time to think about it. That next week, I started to go about my new behavior, but I noticed my wife was still physically and emotionally distant from me. After 6 days, things did not feel right and something told me to ask her if she wanted a divorce. She admitted that she is done with the relationship, but was afraid to say anything and wasn&amp;#39;t sure when she was going to tell me. She admitted that she has felt this way since June. I was completely devastated. My worst nightmare was true and I didn&amp;#39;t know what to do or if it could be saved. She wanted to get a divorce and move the next summer after the school year was over. If possible, she wanted to live together in the same house for the rest of the school year. She said she did not want to go to couples counseling either. I was not happy, but I felt there was no changing her mind. I agreed with this. I wanted to enjoy as much time with the children as possible before they moved away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2nd day I realized I was getting a divorce, I sat down with my son and talked. I told him sorry if I hurt him. I asked him if hated me and he said no. I told him I would miss them very much when they moved, but I was happy to spend the next school year with them. In the last 2 months, our relationship is stronger than ever. I will continue to strengthen our bond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 2 months, I talked with my parents, her mother, several co-workers, friends, family, etc. I would talk to anyone who would listen because it was extremely therapeutic. I took in all the advice and input that anyone would give me. I made an appointment to see a counselor for myself. I realized I had the ability to write out my thoughts better than speak, so I started keeping a journal. By the end of the first week, I wrote my wife 2 letters. The first was about understanding and acceptance of the divorce. The 2nd was a plea to let’s give us 1 more try. She still wants a divorce. I wrote a letter to her sister and mother explaining my thoughts and feelings on the divorce. I&amp;#39;ve written a letter to my co-workers thanking them for their support. I wrote a letter to my siblings about where the source of my anger comes from and how I know how to prevent it. I have shared all my writings with my counselor and she encourages me to continue writing. I started going to bed early and waking up early. I go on morning walks for 30 minutes on most days. I joined an exercise class once a week. I eat less and healthier now. I have lost 25 lbs. and will continue to lose more. I continue to enjoy my counselor meetings once a week. I am a much happier and positive person than I could ever remember being. I like the way I handle my frustrations and conflict resolutions, especially with my children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as our current situation, we are living together very peacefully. We have met with a mediator and are almost through will all the paperwork for divorce. The current agreement is I pay child support and give half my 401k to her, and she will get to move out of state. We are time-sharing the children 80/20 since I live so far away. If I move to Maine, I can get closer to 50/50 custody. We are still friends. We do not hug or have any sexual contact. The time spent at home is very comfortable for the children. They are both aware of the divorce and know that they will move in the summer. She has made no attempts to reconcile the relationship. At this point, I don&amp;#39;t think I would want to. I understand that it is difficult to look at what someone is and not what they were when you spent so much time with them. I do not fault her for this, but it would make trying a second time more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy with who I have become since the realization of divorce. I love myself for putting all this work into improvement and I want to continue my growth. If I had 2nd chance at marriage with her, I would put the same effort into it with profession help. She is too hurt and resentful to try again. I hope that she eventually gets counseling for herself to heal and improve herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm having a frustratingly hard time thinking through the fairness of a proposal, please help.

A and B promise to give C a car at a future date. A and B purchase the car, and own it jointly.

Prior to the determined date, A and B split their assets, no longer owning anything jointly, and the car becomes one of A's assets.

Later, but still prior to the determined date, A asks B to pay half the value of the car to A, because A intends still for the car to go to C, and A has no other car and needs one. A says B should pay for half of the car, because A and B promised together to give the car to C.

That's.... not right is it? Or is it? Since the car now belongs to A, and since A and B already fully paid for it together prior to the separation of assets... B isn't obligated to pay for half the car as part of giving the car to C, correct?

B suspects a better way to characterize it is that A is asking B to help A buy a new car. Is that fair?

B is currently considering proposing that instead, they should buy an entirely new car, as C surely doesn't care \_what\_ car C receives, both contributing proportionally as stipulated in the contract they signed when they separated assets.

,Divorce,"I thought I was over this PTSD.  Abusive relationship.  Final divorce ten years ago.  I remarried a different man and recently divorced him as well.  I am living alone for the first time in my life (LOVElovelove it) in an apartment until I relocate next fall.

Before I nodded off on my couch last night, I had some wine, and I remember thinking how pleasant life was for me right now.  Just what I need.  My own couch.  In my own apartment.  With MY fucking remote to the TV in MY hand, drinking some wine. Ahhhh.....Life is good, after all.  Sleeeeeepy zzzzzzz.

Until BAM BAM BAM!  DING DONG, DING DONG!

What the actual F is going on?! It's about 10:20 PM.  I've been inside my home since 7:30.  All my required responsibilities are in order.  I'm ashamed I fell asleep on my couch.  (why? coz I've been drinking wine by myself).

My first thought is who is at the door, of course.  It's a cop.

Any normal person would answer the door and see how they could assist our finest.  Nope.  Not me.

I panic.

Why?  Because two weeks ago, my ex sent me an email that he was going to kill himself very soon.  I called 911 for a well being check since I don't want my kids to walk into ...well, you know.  

This turned into a bizzarre (yet usual for the abusive ex)  bunch of fall-out between me and my adult kids.

I thought the drama from that was over.  Then BAM!

I honestly couldn't open the door.  I was scared about a lot of things.  Opening that door meant opening it to either ""Sorry to inform you that your ex succeeded in killing himself"" or ""Your ex called a well-being check on you (and I'm drunk)"", or ""There was an accident"" (My 17 year old son died in a car crash 10/10/17 but there was a cop, a coroner and a priest at my door and this young guy was by himself), or this wasn't a cop at all and a plot to rob me (I have only lived here for 3 months), or ""Some crime happened here and we're looking for the perp"".  Or there may be an emergency for the building.

So I didn't answer the door.  I looked, listened and smelled for any emergency.  I did not hear the cops knocking on anyone else's door.  I saw flashing lights against the adjacent building, but no official vehicle in the parking lot outside my front door.

Why?  WHY ARE THE COPS HERE???

No matter what, I know I'm safe.  Safe and sound asleep on my own damn couch at 10:20 at night.  If I open that door, I open it to more drama.  Of which I spend 100% of my time trying to avoid.

So after about 10 minutes of making sure there wasn't a nuclear bomb coming (at this point, I would actually welcome that instant outcome /s), I shut all lights/tv off and sat in my bed.

I looked, listened, smelled some more.  I heard people outside.  Everything seemed totally normal.

And then I realized all my questions would have been answered if I had just answered the door.

Welcome to PTSD.  Don't worry, I've got a therapy appointment soon.  At this point, I don't know why the cops came to my door.  I still have a strong suspicion my ex could have retaliated to my 911 call to his (now proven false) claim of threatening suicide by calling 911 to report something about me.  I wouldn't put it past him.

I met my husband in college and after many years of friendship, when we were both suddenly single at the same time ever, we jumped into a whirlwind romance that somehow lasted long distance and 4 years, culminating in college graduations, adult jobs and finally marriage at 25.


We didn't have the perfect marriage, no one does, but between the long commutes and my heavy work schedule we drifted. So I took a much needed long vacation with my mom. When I came back and things were out of place and my husband was acting weird I went through his phone. And I found pictures, of him in provocative poses in my clothes, my intimates, my shoes. I was devastated.

Breach of his trust aside in snooping I felt heartbroken. Who was this person. After weeks of fights and silence my husband told me he felt gender fluid and enjoyed cross dressing. We attempted to patch things but it didn't work, not really.

Two years of unhappiness later I took time for myself and realized if I was so unhappy even after relocating, getting a new job with better pay and a new car that it was my marriage. Going home and turning the key felt like a jail sentence every night. Who dreads going home? I did.

I asked for a divorce. He fought me tooth and nail. I'm not sure why. At that point he told me he was transgender. He (now she) had spent several months discussing it with coworkers, online on reddit, etc all before I asked for a divorce and she bothered to mention it to me. I was heartbroken, crying and screaming. One phrase always stuck with me. 'They all agree you should be supporting me. This is a tough time for me.'

All I could think was ... you? You need support? I held hands at the alter with my best friend, my man, my husband. The future father of my children. The man who was supposed to support and protect me, teach our future kids everything they needed to know- the best way to catch a pokemon, the superiority of the PS4, drive them to soccer. Hold my hand as we aged and travelled together.

My husband, for all intents and purposes was dead to me. In that moment I felt widowed somehow.

'I'm alone now. I need support.' I responded and that was that.

Finally I agreed to share the remainder of our lease, stay in separate bedrooms and move out at the end of the term and file for divorce. In my mind for tax purposes it was easier and it was to some extent.

She asked if we could make things work. I said only if she got her own counselor. Until then we're separated. I even printed out a paper, a list of names for her to call. She never did.

So I suppose she also asked for a divorce in her own way, by never taking steps to take care of herself first.

I kept my silence and never told anyone in my family what was going on other than I'd asked for the divorce and infidelity wasn't a factor. She updated her facebook and name and a family member put 2 and 2 together and outed the full story to my family. But her family supports her and her work has accepted her transition no problem.

I don't regret anything. I got some pushback from her family for not standing by her, but I felt she left. She couldn't choose to be trans or not I accept that. But she confided in other people, discussed our marriage with others and ultimately wasn't willing to help herself to save our marriage. Even if it would've ultimately been a moot point.

When I came back and things were out of place and my husband was acting weird I went through his phone. And I found pictures, of him in provocative poses in my clothes, my intimates, my shoes. I was devastated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breach of his trust aside in snooping I felt heartbroken. Who was this person. After weeks of fights and silence my husband told me he felt gender fluid and enjoyed cross dressing. We attempted to patch things but it didn&amp;#39;t work, not really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years of unhappiness later I took time for myself and realized if I was so unhappy even after relocating, getting a new job with better pay and a new car that it was my marriage. Going home and turning the key felt like a jail sentence every night. Who dreads going home? I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked for a divorce. He fought me tooth and nail. I&amp;#39;m not sure why. At that point he told me he was transgender. He (now she) had spent several months discussing it with coworkers, online on reddit, etc all before I asked for a divorce and she bothered to mention it to me. I was heartbroken, crying and screaming. One phrase always stuck with me. &amp;#39;They all agree you should be supporting me. This is a tough time for me.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I could think was ... you? You need support? I held hands at the alter with my best friend, my man, my husband. The future father of my children. The man who was supposed to support and protect me, teach our future kids everything they needed to know- the best way to catch a pokemon, the superiority of the PS4, drive them to soccer. Hold my hand as we aged and travelled together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband, for all intents and purposes was dead to me. In that moment I felt widowed somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m alone now. I need support.&amp;#39; I responded and that was that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I agreed to share the remainder of our lease, stay in separate bedrooms and move out at the end of the term and file for divorce. In my mind for tax purposes it was easier and it was to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She asked if we could make things work. I said only if she got her own counselor. Until then we&amp;#39;re separated. I even printed out a paper, a list of names for her to call. She never did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I suppose she also asked for a divorce in her own way, by never taking steps to take care of herself first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept my silence and never told anyone in my family what was going on other than I&amp;#39;d asked for the divorce and infidelity wasn&amp;#39;t a factor. She updated her facebook and name and a family member put 2 and 2 together and outed the full story to my family. But her family supports her and her work has accepted her transition no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t regret anything. I got some pushback from her family for not standing by her, but I felt she left. She couldn&amp;#39;t choose to be trans or not I accept that. But she confided in other people, discussed our marriage with others and ultimately wasn&amp;#39;t willing to help herself to save our marriage. Even if it would&amp;#39;ve ultimately been a moot point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I filed, its official right before new years and today felt like the first day I was truly free and ready to share.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Hi all!
Posting on behalf of my mum (I hope that's okay) I don't know where else to go for advice for her.
My family is me[21F], my brother [26M] and my mum [50F] and father [60M]. 

My father has been abusive towards our family for decades, he has been aggressive but to my knowledge hasn't hit my mum before. In every other sense of the word abusive, financial, emotionally and verbally, he has really made lasting damage on us. My mum and I have been to psychologists in the past few years but haven't gone back in a while.

My mum in the past two years has returned to working and she has saved up as much as she can while also now paying for half of the bills.

I'm going to be moving out soon because I mentally really can't handle it, him just raising his voice triggers a panic attack.

My mum has no social support group, no one to get advice and has heard tragic stories of women ending up homeless from divorce.  She's afraid she'll lose everything (they own 2 houses in both their names).

I'm afraid to leave her and I want her to start making plans to leave. Can anyone here tell me a bit about divorce works? How property splits? Is it even possible to lose everything? Can my father manipulate/lie to the courts?

,Divorce,"Well, it appears my ex is still finding ways to make my life a living hell even after final orders are issued.

&amp;#x200B;

We were officially divorce last week \*YAY\* but the orders are not filed in the court yet (or at least not that I can see). Included in the final agreement were orders that he pay health insurance, we use OFW for all communication, and he continues to pay CS, a slightly higher amount. If you've seen my previous posts ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/b0eo87/tx_child_support_via_payroll/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/b6r0po/update_child_support_via_payroll/)), you know that our CS issue was a little tricky and convoluted. TL;DR: he was using his company's payroll to pay CS, shorting me over $1200 in withholdings by the end of 2018. Thankfully I am now able to file my taxes and will get that back.

&amp;#x200B;

After the hearing, they seemed thrilled with the judgment, and I was pretty satisfied with how things came out.  I thought all was well and good, we were finally *done* (HA-HA), and could start really living our lives separately. Well, that seems to not be the case. Here are just a few of the ways he and his new fiance have continued to fuck with me post-judgment. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Although he was ordered in temp orders to continue paying the AT&amp;T bill that was in my name, he failed to do so. There is a past due balance of $500+ that is about to go into collections, and he has since ported his number to Verizon. 
2. On the DAY OF the final hearing, I received a child support (AKA PAYROLL) deposit. The day after the hearing, it was withdrawn from my account. I've already filed a dispute with my bank, so we'll see if that gets fixed.
3. Despite being ordered to communicate using OFW, he is circumventing the system by communicating through his fiance, who is a real peach. Screenshot of her text below. Both of them are very confrontational and literally do not think rules apply to them, but get absolutely enraged if they think I'm not following the orders. At this point I have to do all communication through his fiance because he refuses to sign up for OFW due to ""money issues.""
4. Lied about finances. Unfortunately my attorney did not do discovery on his finances, so all we had was his word that he makes XX amount of money a month. After the hearing, I found out that he had just purchased an $80,000 vehicle, the loan amount and all of his other massive bills would leave him with about $500 a month to live on, if that. I suspect he has been working cash jobs and is not including that in his income.
5. Just general irritation at being trash-talked on social media and outright lies being told about me. I don't let this bother me too much, but I would be lying if I said it didn't annoy me a little.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a feeling that he is going to avoid following court orders completely. He did it with our temporary orders and he is making a pattern of doing it again with the final orders. I'd like to file contempt at some point, but I'm sure there needs to be some distance between the final hearing first. However, I also don't want to just put up with him walking all over me for however long that is. I've been his doormat for 6 years and I'm not doing that anymore.

,Divorce,"August 24th 2019, my little world was rocked. More like thrown out the window. My wife of almost 10 years, and partner of 12 years announced, right after we finished an episode of Mindhunter, that she wanted a divorce. Just like that, I want a divorce, I'm done. Out of the blue. Almost as if you were telling someone, I dont like this movie. I want it off.  

Just 5 days shy of our 10th year wedding anniversary. Just over a year after we moved out to British Columbia, 5000 km away from were I grew up. I was and still am devastated. I soon made plans to get out of the house, I was already going back home to see some family and friends in late September, and moved up the date of my departure, so I could process this out of the house, around friends.  We also have 2 young kids, how are still not aware of what's going on. 

So off I went, August 27th, to Montreal, Canada, for a month. Missed out on my oldest birthday, his first day of second grade and his birthday party. It was very hard on me to be away from my kids, and dealing with the large wound this situation created.  We also made a verbal agreement, that while we are sharing a house, we should not see anyone else romantically, ( I was not planning to anyways, but I was afraid she was) She didn't listen. While I was gone, she told me how happy she was that I was out of the house, how good it was making her feel, and how she wanted to move out of the house, fast. Like real fast, she was looking at homes while I was gone. She also told me that she went out with friends of her, to have a good time ( that was a lie, she was dating other men).

When I came back, September 23rd, first thing she told me in the car, was how happy she now is, and that she wouldn't hide it from me. Like a slap in the face, as I was still dealing with the emotional trauma of her asking for a divorce. Later on that night, after questioning her about all this, I found out  that she was already seeing someone else, and how he was this good looking guy that was making her feel in love all over again. Bam, another slap in the face. 

She was adamant that I was to deal with this and accept it, as it was now her private life, and that she has no responsibility for my emotions and that she doesn't owe me anything.  I was even more devastated. Later on that week and this week, I got her to admit that she in fact had seen 3 men, went out on dates, had sex with them over the phone and via text message, and even hung out with one of them, with my kids present.

I finally got her to sign a separation agreement that was forbidding her to see other men romantically, while we live in the same house, but apparently, I am asking too much, I am impeding on her happiness, and that I should be okay with all this, right away. Apparently,  I am an ass for controlling her life. Remember, this is all in the span of one month. 

I am humiliated, sad, lost, and resentful. I feel betrayed, cheated, and cheaply played. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I ended up in the ER, after an attempt on my life, as it felt more and more unbearable. I didn't really want to die, but I wanted the pain and humiliation to stop. it was a call for help.  Everyone in our little town is aware, some even told me that she was spotted in town with may different guys, My kid bus driver saw her on a couple of occasions...  We are still at this point currently, I have terrible nightmares at night, and she is extremely resentful to me for stoping her to see other men. She is constantly texting his new love affair, and she is still adamant that I am asking for too much and that I am a prick trying to control her, and how petty I am. I am not sure of what to ask here, or why I'm even sharing all of this, but here I am. 

I am glad to be alive, and I know this will define the man that will come out the other end, but I am also lost and can't see a way out right now. I feel stuck, sad, hurt, humiliated, broken, and without any self confidence in me. Please tell me I am not a crazy asshole for asking her to give me time to process all of this, to stop seeing other men while we share a house, and to give me some sort of self dignity back. Please tell me it will be okay, and that I will be happy again, and able to trust again, at some point down the road.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not ready. I keep going back and forth on my feelings for her. She&amp;#39;s the mother of my daughter, I love her with all my heart. We made a promise in marriage. But then, she doesn&amp;#39;t love me. In the middle of her emotional affair she began telling me all these reasons it was me who failed us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning my feeling is absolute anger. I don&amp;#39;t know how this is going to go. The thought of waiting in the lobby with her makes me ache. I&amp;#39;m just not ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: this session was absolutely useless. Just talked about me and my issues for most of it, then about how she&amp;#39;s totally done and I&amp;#39;m lagging behind in not being on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next appointment was scheduled for December. This is a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"For the record, I’m not back with her. But I did discover the only way to win your spouse back. It was a hard lesson, but worth the experience and hopefully it can help somebody else out.

Some backstory. We had a 16 month and 3 year old kids and my wife left me for a co-worker. I was not a perfect husband, but I would like to think, and have been told, I was a great husband. I have a great job, worked normal hours, gave up my social life to be home with her and the kids after work and on weekends, remodeled our entire house as planned (she says I spent too much time on this, despite requesting and enjoying the upgrades), never strayed, supported her during her (mostly unpaid) maternity leave by staying up late to do night feedings so she could sleep, taking our oldest to daycare out of the way, so she could sleep in, handling all the finances because she didn’t want to handle them, etc. Yet, when she went back to work at the beginning of the year, she turned mean toward me. I later found out she had started an emotional affair with a coworker that led to a kiss. During our therapy, she gaslit me and called me crazy when I assumed there was more and focused our time on her resentment towards me (some fair, some unfair IMO). However, she continued her emotional affair with him (I was not crazy, after all) and eventually fell in love and left me for him. I was devastated that I lost my best friend, wife, and travel partner and that she didn’t think our marriage, which had great moments during this year (one of our best dates ever was less than a month before she said she didn’t want to be married anymore), wasn’t worth it anymore, despite our family we had built.

I had to do whatever I could to keep my family, and somehow get back the wife I remembered. Because the current woman is not a person I recognize. As an aside, I am pretty sure that untreated postpartum depression led to a lot of resentment and anxiety in her, combined with returning to a high stress job. So I told her everything we were losing and asked her to really think if she wants to give that up. I told her everything I did to support her, which she couldn’t even acknowledge. When I told her she used to be my best friend, she couldn’t even respond. Of courses all the advice I read (and from talking to people who had been in her shoes before) said that approach never works and will just drive her farther away. They were right. It made her even more resentful that I wasn’t hearing her. I told her she can be mad, but she married me because I would be a dedicated husband and family man and that’s exactly why I was pleading. And the old version of her would be cheering me on. All the advice actually said to go on living your life and show confidence, and THAT was the only possible way to win them back.

At some point, I had to realize it was done. It was hard at first, but I was surprised how fast I became at peace with it. A few things helped. First, I focused on my own health and happiness that I could control. I worked out, ate healthy, did things that brought joy, re-connected with friends, etc. Second, I made sure that I put all the energy I could into my kids. I made sure we did things that were fun, that I showed them how much joy they brought me, and made sure they were physically and psychologically safe. This brought me even more peace and joy. Third, I started talking to old friends again and dating other people. This showed me that I wasn’t worthless and that there were good people out there who could give me what she wasn’t giving me: kindness, joy, affection, and other things that don’t match what you get from somebody you’re in love with and married to, but still feel good and aren’t hard when you’re interested in getting to know somebody new. I also moved out into a place I love.

Things turned for the better pretty quickly when I realized how little I was appreciated and that maybe I wasn’t losing this special gem I thought she was. That maybe she was causing unhappiness in my life. In fairness, two young kids cause A LOT of stress and we had issues with them, so a lot of that stress was projected onto each of us. But I started feeling happy and realizing that maybe I was actually escaping a situation that wasn’t great for me. I also read an essay called “Welcome to Holland,” that if you’ haven’t read it, I would pause this and go read it (it takes less than five minutes). That put into perspective the fact that, while, I didn’t want or plan on this situation, I could spend my time being depressed about the situation I wasn’t in, or smell the roses and see the benefits of my current situation.

My communication with her became friendly, instead of tense, thanks to my peacefulness. Texts were few and far between and terse. Not intentionally, but because I was adjusting to and enjoying my new life. One of the first weekends apart, I took the kids to my parents. I missed her. I missed our teamwork when we went away together. But, the weekend went smooth and I had confidence in being able to take care of the kids myself. When I got back, she told me she missed all of us and our family. It was the first time she missed me in months. But she still refused to open up and I left the house and went back to normal life. The following weekend, she wanted to do something as a family. I told her I will if she wants, but (I didn’t say this) I didn’t need it and was good either way. She came over to my place, we hung out with the kids, went to the park, ate dinner, went swimming, and made cookies. Like the perfect American family, except for one major thing! She told me she missed the family and was thinking about things.

Two days later, it was our 8th anniversary. She sent a text early in the morning that she couldn’t believe we were apart and that things changed so fast. She was sad and reflective. I didn’t respond because I didn’t know exactly what she meant and I didn’t want to fall for anymore mind games. I was moving on. That night, she was texting me playful texts (not flirty) and I responded, but she asked if she was talking to a robot. I told her I wanted to come by the next day, since I was going to be in the neighborhood, and see our dog and the kids. She asked me to stay for dinner. I knew something was up. I called her after some texts because I could tell she wanted to talk. We talked for 5-10 minutes, but again, she wouldn’t fully open up.

The next day, we had therapy with our couples therapist to focus on the separation and co-parenting. I knew what was coming. She said she was confused and missed me. But she was still confused about who she wanted to be with (me or him) and if she wanted to be married. She could now see all the support I gave her over the years and that I wasn’t uninvolved and, as she put it before, her third child. She is worried that she broke the trust and it’s irreparable. That I’m happier without her. That she might not be able to stay away from the new guy. That I actually don’t miss her. 

We talked for the hour, but didn’t go too far into her feelings. I don’t even know if she’s 50/50 on getting back together or 90% sure she still doesn’t want to be married, but has a couple small doubts. I’m not even sure I would want to get back together myself, or how we would do that after all the damage. But, it’s possible. It was impossible when I was begging before. I have no idea what she’s going to choose, or what I’m going to choose, for that matter. But hopefully my story can help somebody else in a similar situation. It’s hard to listen to that advice when somebody tells you that the best way to win your spouse back is to basically let them go be with somebody else while you’re unhappy. But it really is the best way forward to happiness and possible reconciliation. Stop trying to control what you can’t, and focus on you. If you both want it, it may resolve itself. If not, there’s light at the end of the tunnel.

,Divorce,"My wife and I have been married for four years and things aren't going well. We have a three-year-old child. We haven't slept in the same bed in months, haven't had sex in probably six months or more, and we tolerate each other and are civil. She wants to move back to the east coast to be closer to her friends, I have no desire to do that especially with divorce looming so I wouldn't be trapped there. 

Currently, she is a SAHM, with my child going to daycare three days a week. I've broached the subject that it is probably time to start figuring out what she wants to do career-wise when he starts going to school full time. I've offered to start her up a business, pay for school, whatever... There hasn't been any movement there and it is starting to be a point of contention. I own my own business which has had a bad 18 months so my salary essentially got cut in half, while it's still good money having her do anything would ease the burden a little bit. She doesn't seem interested. (She actually fired a housecleaner that comes every two weeks in an ""effort to save money""... So she is saying by cleaning the house it eats up all her time when our child is in preschool.) 

She wants to move into a bigger house and move to a better school district but basically live in the middle of nowhere. I like our neighborhood right now since there are numerous neighbors around my son's age. Our house is small but we could build on it cheaper than buying something larger in our neighborhood. Also, I can walk to work and am able to return home to help out whenever necessary, he can come visit me at work, and I don't waste time commuting. 

Along with wanting to move into a bigger house, my wife wants to go down to one car since I don't need mine to commute. Her's is older and paid off, mine is winding down on a three-year lease. I don't want to go down to one car because I can see it just being something she complains about or incessantly texts me about if I have it and am gone. 

She keeps saying she would be happier with these new things, I don't think it fixes the problems in our marriage but it does allow us to not be cramped in a house with a child and two dogs. I'm lukewarm on both because of the reasons stated above and if we do get divorced I will be overextended by a lot. The house we currently have I purchased before we were married and she has never contributed anything to it financially. 

I feel like she wants the bigger hours possibly for the reasons she has stated above but also maybe to manipulate a larger divorce settlement. We don't have a prenup, so I was thinking about outlining a postnuptial agreement to minimize my financial downside on this? Or is the writing just on the wall enough to just get a divorce? 

My biggest fear with divorce is that she is going to attempt to take my child and move across the country with him because she doesn't have a job or ""roots"" here it will be an easier sell.",t2_4q7a9a85,False,,0,False,Postnuptial agreement or just divorce?,[],r/Divorce,False,1,,0,False,t3_ddbp8z,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1570244111.0,text,1,,text,self.Divorce,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have been married for four years and things aren&amp;#39;t going well.

&lt;p&gt;She wants to move into a bigger house and move to a better school district but basically live in the middle of nowhere. I like our neighborhood right now since there are numerous neighbors around my son&amp;#39;s age. Our house is small but we could build on it cheaper than buying something larger in our neighborhood. Also, I can walk to work and am able to return home to help out whenever necessary, he can come visit me at work, and I don&amp;#39;t waste time commuting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with wanting to move into a bigger house, my wife wants to go down to one car since I don&amp;#39;t need mine to commute. Her&amp;#39;s is older and paid off, mine is winding down on a three-year lease. I don&amp;#39;t want to go down to one car because I can see it just being something she complains about or incessantly texts me about if I have it and am gone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She keeps saying she would be happier with these new things, I don&amp;#39;t think it fixes the problems in our marriage but it does allow us to not be cramped in a house with a child and two dogs. I&amp;#39;m lukewarm on both because of the reasons stated above and if we do get divorced I will be overextended by a lot. The house we currently have I purchased before we were married and she has never contributed anything to it financially. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like she wants the bigger hours possibly for the reasons she has stated above but also maybe to manipulate a larger divorce settlement. We don&amp;#39;t have a prenup, so I was thinking about outlining a postnuptial agreement to minimize my financial downside on this? Or is the writing just on the wall enough to just get a divorce? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest fear with divorce is that she is going to attempt to take my child and move across the country with him because she doesn&amp;#39;t have a job or &amp;quot;roots&amp;quot; here it will be an easier sell.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"My wife and I separated in May, I moved out June 1st, and she filed all of the paperwork at the end of August. I just received all of the paperwork in the mail a week ago. 

I just found out she's pregnant and she admitted it wasn't mine, as she just found out, too. (there was 0% chance of it being mine because of the timing of the last time we had sex). We are civil, but have essentially removed each other from our lives and agreed to let the other one do as they wished until the divorce was final. I'm fine with her seeing other people (and obviously sleeping with them), as I've been doing the same. 

Anyway, my first question I'm proposing is should we amend our paperwork to indicate that she is (at the time of her filing, she did not know)? Or should we just leave it as is?

My second question has to do with insurance. I verbally agreed to continue to cover her on my insurance plan for 2020 as part of our agreement when we decided to go through with the divorce. I was just going to leave her on and let the window for removing her post divorce expire, then just not re-enroll her for 2021. However, this complicates everything. Since the majority of her pregnancy will be next year, should I still keep her on the plan? I'm currently in my open enrollment period, so all is have to do now is go in and change it.

,Divorce,"BACKGROUND:
In short STBXH had an affair when I was 8-month pregnant which continued until the LO is 5 month old! During this time he insisted in the divorce as he’s not happy with the marriage, even though we just have a baby. I had no choice but agree to the divorce so we can move on to arranging for the co-parenting situation. 
There were of course lots of arguments, batsh*t crazy stuff done by me admittedly (because he continued the affair which triggered my emotional pain &amp; anger). Anyway we’re now at a “ceasefire” stage so we can mutually agree on the finances &amp; custody. 

STATUS:
Divorce application filed by STBXH, uncontested by me. He’ll applying for the Degree Nisi soon and we will need to officially agree on asset division, child support, spouse maintenance. We’ll have a mediator and do separation/co-parenting counselling. 

UPDATE:
Separation counselling booked and will start next week. One session per week.

I’m still having my weekly therapy session for another 4 weeks or so. I’ve been doing this for 5-6 weeks and it has helped to talk to someone on a regularly basis and cry it out. However I feel I need more specialist help. 

I try to go to the gym a few times a week. I like doing spinning (cycling), yoga, circuit training, swimming. So far I go to spinning, yoga, swimming relatively regularly. I only just started circuit training  but will try to commit to it more as it offers good calories burn and improve core strength. 

I went to a pole dancing class and really like it. So I signed up for another trial class. If I like this school, I will sign up for another 20 classes. I know, quite a big commitment! 

I use a few dating apps. Been to a few dates. Only one of them truly brought me some connection, feelings and joy. However the guy doesn’t seem so keen to meet up again (we’re still messaging in friendly term but I have to initiate, keep the conversation going :( I haven’t given up so will keep going with these apps. 

I also signed up for a membership of social group on Meetup. This means I have to go to some heavily party styled event once a week! I managed to go to one so far so I need to make more effort to go more of their events! 

I like Gone Girl International events. They’re usually quite relaxing stuff (movie night, drinks, book club) and it’s nice to meet new girlfriends.

,Divorce,"My STBXH cuts of communication from me.  We’re separated and I’ve just moved into a new apartment.  We haven’t had a single discussion about “matters of the heart.”  He is only willing to discuss logistics.

What led to this is we had an argument, he took off to his mother’s house, turned his phone off, and checked out.  He’s done this before and knew that if it happened again I would be done.  I spent those two days feeling like I was going crazy.  I feel like cutting off like that is not “space” as he says.

He comes back and says he wants a divorce.  He had gone to his counsellor who told him not to discuss the emotional reasons, so he won’t.  I said I too was wanting to divorce based on him leaving for two days, but would be willing to hear him out.

We went to a different counsellor, one we’d seen together before.  I told him I was willing to save the marriage, he said he needed time to decide if he could and that he still wants me to move out.

So I moved, alone, because after that appointment he went to stay with a friend.  He wanted his space and no communication.  I asked if he’d decided if this is a trial separation or permanent, and was told not to talk about that.  I’m pushing for him to decide.  He’s going to a lawyer and I’ll be hearing from them, not him.  So I guess that’s my answer.

Yesterday, this all hit me like a wall of bricks.  I had to go home early from work and was an absolute mess.    I called.  He told me I breached his boundary, I told him he was being an ass.  He told me to call a hotline to talk to someone because he can’t be my emotional support. 

I don’t need him as emotional support.  I have a wonderful friend, R, who listens to me at all hours of the day and night, my mother, and the most supportive boss you could ever ask for.  I would like to have an honest, respectful conversation with my STBXH about what is happening.

That friend?  She is the ex of my STBXH and I’s very good friend, J.  J has been supportive to both of us and I guess my STBXH told J the reasons he didn’t want to work on things.  J told my friend who told me.  Both J and my friend R feel put in the middle, and I feel like I’m back in high school.  R was on the phone with me last night and could see how emotionally stressed I was.  She told me to help me.  The reasons are valid and make sense.  They make him seem less like an ass.  It would be nice to hear from him though.

I can’t make someone check back in, and I certainly don’t want to be married to someone who disassociates like this, but it hurts, I’m angry/sad/all the things.  It makes me honestly feel crazy.

▪️Our trial date for our divorce is in December
▪️my son claims he is mad at me and won't speak to me unless I move home
▪️I know this is parental alienation, and the counselor won't listen to me whatsoever
▪️my husband is now saying he wants to call off divorce and reconcile, but won't get rid of his gf

I’ve been with my husband for 7 years, married for two with no kids. I’ve spent a lot of that time feeling emotionally neglected if not abused. Now I’m not perfect, but I’ve always tried to make him feel good and loved. Nothing I do is good enough even though I work 12-16 hour days 6 days a week, and still come home and cook dinner/sometimes do some cleaning. I’m constantly criticized for small things, belittled, ignored, and told I’m like a child. We don’t have much to talk about and very little in common. Since we moved in together 5 years ago I’ve always felt like him hanging out with me was like a chore he had to do. He constantly has something else he’s doing whether it’s video games or golf (which of course I support in moderation but the majority of the time I’m second fiddle). Our relationship was pretty passionate early on and even up until recently our sex life was pretty good, but in June he told me I’d “let it go” and he was getting to the point of being unattracted to me. I’ve gained weight but I’m definitely not someone most people would consider overweight, in fact I’m pretty confident in how I look and get a lot of attention from men. Ever since then I’ve had this wall up. I feel like I snapped. I look back on the last 4-5 years, how many nights I sobbed in to my pillow, feeling hurt and worthless and completely alone, and I feel like I’ve been in this delusional fog that I’m just now waking up from. He can sense this, and I know he’s terrified of losing me cuz he’s said it, and he’s going above and beyond being the best husband he can be. Super loving, affectionate, sweet ect. Problem is, I feel annoyed and pushed further away by his efforts. I still love him dearly. But it’s more in a familial type of way. Like I want to take care of him and don’t want to see him hurt. I still want to cuddle him at night and watch movies together. But the thought of sharing a child together one day....or just having him revert back to his old self and spending the rest of my life like that...absolutely terrifies me.

,Divorce,"# Learning to fall in Love...with myself.

Okay- so one of the first things that EVERYONE tells you during this time of separation, or divorce- is to ""Focus on yourself"".  This was super frustrating for me at first, because I didn't know what the hell that meant.  I was doing what I wanted, WHEN I wanted, and that felt good...isn't that""focusing on me""?  Well no...it felt good until it didn't.  My behavior wasn't focusing ""on me"", instead there was no focus at all, no thought to the reckless path I was going down- like a toddler in rebellion.  My actions were selfish.  I acted as if there would be no consequence, yet I would feel the sting of remorse every.  single.  time.  

I started to drop my ""crutches"" as I realized I had to do better by myself.  No alcohol when upset or even alone.  No ""guys attention"" or dates for distraction.  No more confiding in people I only half-ass trusted.  I started to watch youtube (yes- youtube) videos on how to get through this crap.  I had an Epiphany.  How can someone (me) act this way...how could I not feel empathy on the ones it would hurt.  I mean sure, I didn't think anyone would be hurt, but how could I have been so naive?  I was told today by my soon to be ex, that ""You don't treat people you love this way"".  And he's right.  But it wasn't about him.  It was about me.  It was about self-love.  I realized I did NOT love myself.  Not at all.  I had always been someone's half...I had never been on my own to experience what MY individual self could do, could accomplish, could feel.  I don't even know who I am without him.

The background I came from was a murky one.  My parents were not an example of a happy marriage.  My mother had a rough life...HAS a rough life still...but that's another story.  I had been abandoned in the past, let down several times, mistreated by those I trusted, and violated...and I still feel like that was my fault- how fucked is that.  My representation of ""love"" was never a healthy one.  How in the world does one ""learn"" to love themselves.  

Well...tonight I realized the answer.  In order to love yourself...you need to FALL in love with yourself.  And how does one fall in love?  Go on a date and get to know yourself.  I had a fairly good day today...I had made goals this morning, and accomplished most.  One of my goals was to go to the gym.  I signed up at this gym the next town over, and I'm also a member at the YMCA.  I was thinking I would cancel my membership at the gym...just to save some money during this time.  As I was driving to the gym, my thoughts changed.  I would instead work out there, do me some good.

SO- I head in to the parking lot- it's packed...I get that feeling of dread.  But I'll go anyway, be bigger than my fear.  But then I see HIS truck...an important person to me...but still a crutch that I dropped.  I said NOPE.  Not working out, going home.  But I thought about it more- and decided that I would stick to my ORIGINAL plan and go in, head held high, and cancel my membership.  I don't ever want to feel this way ever about something that should be good for me.  So I did just that.  I'm don’t know if he saw me.  I didn't look to see.  

I cancelled that membership and anxiety, and left to head towards the other gym.  I was proud of myself, for making a decision that would be better for me in the long run.  I'm driving down main street and I see our local movie theater that also serves food and drinks...playing a movie I had forgotten about that I wanted to see.  I made a split decision and TOOK MYSELF OUT ON A DATE.  You see, I was kinda liking myself at this point- the decisions I made on my own, the ""bravery"" it took to overcome that anxiety.  I liked this chick...

So this is how you fall in love with yourself.  Learning to love yourself- it requires learning to get to KNOW yourself.  Not me as a mom, or a wife, or a business owner, or as a body that is non-stop, full throttle on the go...but the me that skipped working out to enjoy life, solo.  So I gave my drink order to my waitress...I didn't know what I wanted, so I spoiled myself.  I had a cappuccino, a coca-cola, and a bottle of water.  (And at the end of my dinner I had a cup of tea!)

I actually giggled at myself for all the drinks laid out in front of me, and I was pleased that none of them were alcohol.  That made me like 'me' a little more than I did yesterday.  Now, the audience for this movie, 'Downton Abbey', was like, all over 70.  Every time a snarky remark was made by one of the characters, the audience of grandmas and grandpas would burst out laughing, so loud, so carefree.  It made me laugh too.  I was happy to be there.  Happy to eat almost the entire giant bowl of chef salad.  I was happy and proud of myself for going somewhere in my town solo.  Somewhere healthy for me to be, somewhere I could learn a little bit about me, the real me- and enjoy my own company.  I learned that I'm brave.  I'm spontaneous.  That I would rather have it all than not be sure...

&lt;p&gt;Okay- so one of the first things that EVERYONE tells you during this time of separation, or divorce- is to &amp;quot;Focus on yourself&amp;quot;.  This was super frustrating for me at first, because I didn&amp;#39;t know what the hell that meant.  I was doing what I wanted, WHEN I wanted, and that felt good...isn&amp;#39;t that&amp;quot;focusing on me&amp;quot;?  Well no...it felt good until it didn&amp;#39;t.  My behavior wasn&amp;#39;t focusing &amp;quot;on me&amp;quot;, instead there was no focus at all, no thought to the reckless path I was going down- like a toddler in rebellion.  My actions were selfish.  I acted as if there would be no consequence, yet I would feel the sting of remorse every.  single.  time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to drop my &amp;quot;crutches&amp;quot; as I realized I had to do better by myself.  No alcohol when upset or even alone.

&amp;#x200B;

But those are fantasies.  Those aren't who he is.  I don't know how one can be in their 30s and still hold onto such narrow perspectives.  But he's never been strong in empathy, and my empathy has only increased with time.  I look at who I am without him, and it's who I want to be.  I look at who I am when I try to make our marriage work, and I have to adopt all these burdensome, ego-saving, conversational rules that seep into me and hold me back from growing.  When I'm with him, I'm anxious, tired, spent, unreciprocated, cranky, short-tempered, and have difficulty with other people.  In order to empathize with him, I was literally sucked into a way of thinking that alienated me from others.  It's the classic narcissist-empath story.

&amp;#x200B;

When I left him, even though things were cold and sharp, they were no longer heavy.  I had to encounter a lot of life without the comfort of his love (which had been gone for months anyway), but I felt like I could breathe the way I wanted to breathe.  I could say what I wanted to say.  I didn't have to worry about being criticized.  My love for myself grew so much that I actually started hating the thought of someone else making me doubt myself (not like, in a shallow way, like ""Are you sure that's correct?""  But in a deep way like ""How could you call yourself skilled if you make these ultra-specific-and-inconsequential kinds of errors?"")

&amp;#x200B;

Guys.  A few nights ago I was writing at my computer.  A bit stoned, not gonna lie.  Something happened.  I've been working hard on self-love for four years now (there was a direct correlation between my increase of self-love and the decrease of our relationship).  My self-love has been a little dude with a water pistol, spraying in the same spot on this mountain of my self-doubt and self-criticism and self-loathing.  Well, this dude has been spraying his little pistol for years, and he's made cracks in this mountain.  And a few nights ago, this little dude sprayed one more time.  And the mountain started crumbling.  Slowly, steadily, irrevocably.  I held my head in my hands.  I felt it happening.  The mountain (not all, but a lot of it) tumbled down, faster and faster.  I had an orgasm in my brain.  There were tears.  There was shaking.  There was electricity.  It was an avalanche of acceptance.  All I could do was hold myself and say, ""Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  .... ..... .... ..... .... ... Fuck.""

,Divorce,"** OUT of the house, sorry , on mobile. Long story short, I was with my partner for 6 years. Lived together for 3. We are joint owners of our home. He decided to leave 6 months ago and never came home. During this 6 months, he has lived at his mother’s house. 

2 months into our living separately situation, I was in a terrible car accident and almost died. Was in the hospital for quite awhile. 

During this time I have been staying at my parents to have them take care of me until I heal. Our home is vacant at the moment besides my parents and him checking out mail every so often. 

We have no children together. We decided to sell our house prior to my accident. After second thoughts (so many thoughts while sitting in this bed trying to heal!), I got to thinking about buying my spouse out of the house with my settlement money from this accident. I live very close to my parents and think it would be best if I need anything later on in the healing process so they can be at my house fast. 

Anyway, what I’m basically getting at is I need opinions. I’m not trying to sound like a huge wimp, but, for anyone who’s spouse left their shared home and you stayed, how was the emotional coping? I am worried if I buy him out, the loneliness and memories will haunt the shit out of me! I was not the initiator nor did I want this whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

Tiny backstory: I'm a 32/m. Got married at 18 to my high school girlfriend (the devil). She had an affair at 25 (7-8) years of being together), got pregnant, I filed and we stayed separated for a year. We reconciled for 1 more year then finally got the real deal divorce. That was in 2015, it was at that time that I started dating my current wife. I met her in 2013 during my first sep. from the ex wife, thought she was drop dead gorgeous, amazingly intelligent, and something about her made me not want to pursue her because I knew I wasn't in the head space to have a real relationship due to the chaos I was in at the time (ex wife was preg for AP, I was in between many women, it was a cluster).

So in 2015 I decided to reach out, we clicked immediately. We were perfect for each other. No one in my life has ever had my back like she did. We were inseparable, which was odd for both of us since neither one of us really like being around people a whole lot. Without writing a novel I can simply say, we both were very surprised with how close we were and wanted to be as time went on, both mentally and physically. The first 2 years were amazing, hands down the best two years of either of our lives and that still stands true to this day. the 3rd year was hard, she had a miscarriage, and a difficult pregnancy for our shared son start immediately after. She was in high stress the whole time, and I wasn't very good at cutting her slack. She was in constant fear of losing our son, so she was very hormonal, short fused, and anxiety ridden 24 hours a day, and I was a complete asshole about it. After he was born, we got married (we were engaged when she got pregnant, so we pushed it back for the wedding dress and all that stuff) and that year was full of lots of ups and downs, but the downs kept going lower and lower. We started saying things to each other in front of the kids that we are both ashamed of to this day. 

I had threatened to leave many times, due to the hostility, I'd taken my ring off, said ""fuck this"", etc, etc. She never would take it off. She was determined to make it work. Until she started her new career... She started devoting time to becoming a successful realtor, which I financed and encouraged because I honestly believed (and was right) that she'd gain some confidence if she saw how brilliant and talented she is at talking to people and would be able to showcase her amazing attention to detail. She's a rockstar and she's only in her first 3 months. However my insecurities got the best of me, and I assumed she was checking out. Things imploded, I lost it one night, threatened one of her co-workers, accused her of cheating (with no evidence what so ever) and she finally had enough. She left, she was devastated, but that combined with how toxic we were in front of the kids, the constant threats of me leaving her (because of the hostility, I still maintain that I wont deal with that) was too much.

&amp;#x200B;

She came back for a week, we had a no sex until we are settled emotionally rule, when we did the deed, she said she didn't feel the same and left permanently that time, moving all her and my step daughters/infant sons things out into her parents house. We were split for nearly a month, my ex wife had called me a few times to ""check"" on me and I told my wife about it when she was getting a few things she left behind. She lost her shit and blamed me, told me she always knew I'd go back to her, started crying and having a panic attack. I had gotten pissed at the idea that she thought I'd entertain my ex's advances (if could even call them that) said some stuff and stormed out. I decided I had one more thing to say. I marched back in there, walked right up to her, and the next thing we knew we had sex again. This time however was very emotional for both of us. Sparks and the whole 9, like the beginning. She started crying and left. I was filing that Monday.

So it's been a month since then. The day I went to file she told me she didn't want me to. That we are both still very much in love with each other, but the fact that the kids are drawing pictures of us arguing at school is why we need to work our shit out from different houses (I got an apartment and shes at her parents), and once the trust is there that we can talk through issues or at least ""pause"" and not let it get intense in front of the kids, we can re-join the family together. 

We've made strides and there have been set backs. We've gone from me not seeing my step daughter at all, to me picking her up from school again, and helping her with her homework (along with my 2 kids as well). The kids are all much happier, we are being a lot kinder to each other, mostly. She still gets snappy and accuses me of being an asshole or taking a ""tone"" with her, BUT, my entire life I've been called an asshole, uncaring, apathetic, etc. I always feel like I have to defend myself when I say ""I'm not trying to be mean"" or ""I don't know why you're upset"". I was just diagnosed with ASD (High functioning Autism/Asperger) last week. I sought out therapy to figure out why the hell everyone ends up hating me after loving me so much in the beginning. My therapist is an expert in the field and said maybe 2/10 psych people would pick up on what's up with my brain. I had a rough childhood and had to adapt and blend to survive, so I trained myself up on being able to read intentions and just people in general, so for the most part I seem completely Neuro typical, until you start lining up my tendencies, patterns, coping mechanisms, and my perception of complex emotional things (... like in a marriage). So, I'm trying to make her understand and she is trying to understand, that she's going to misinterpret things I say, and vice versa. We don't think the same and I have a diagnosis to prove it. All my weird quirks were some of the reasons she fell in love with me. Now they just make me seem like an asshole, so the goal is for us to understand how we perceive things better so we can not have a misunderstanding for every little thing.

She's slept over once in the apartment(no sex), we've seen each other at least once a day otherwise. The kids are getting more involved and it seems like things are going in a positive direction. But the misunderstandings are still triggering her to think I'm being hateful, despite me now having an actual diagnosis to prove what I used to say, ""If I was angry, you'd know."" We are going to dinner tonight, unless she cancels anyway. We aren't on our facebooks anymore, neither one of us have our rings on, it's a slow, weird, odd situation. I'm cautious, I'm the type of person that needs to see something 15 times to be convinced, the no rings, no facebooks (even though I initiated both... stupid me) just makes me feel like publicly we aren't together, even though, mostly everyone knows we are seeing each other, and she's posting photos of all the kids together again (our older 2 are mine from my first marriage, and everyone knows she left to spare the kids from the bullshit we caused, so her putting up photos is a big deal). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not ready for divorce number 2 at 32 years old. I want this to work, but at the same time, only if it's ""right"". I won't settle for complacency anymore. She's insanely attractive, intelligent, a nerd (like myself), and family focused, so she's definitely a catch. But if the resentment can't dissipate, and the trust be rebuilt, it's pointless. If she or I react to every little thing we don't like defensively like we have been, it'll just be more of the same hostile crap.

I'm just all fucked up. My first divorce was cut and dry. It hurt like hell, I was betrayed, she was cold and hateful, and with another guy. This one is a whole different kind of pain, we can't stop being around each other, we both feel better when we are nearby and things aren't tense. She says ""I love you"" 55 times a day and I know she does, I can see it and feel it. I think that's what makes this harder. At least we are trying to rebuild, I just feel very alone some times. It sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if any of this even made sense. I'm a mess.

Update: Well, things have taken a turn for the better, which is surely a new thing for me.

We had a great weekend and it seems like she may be moving back in. We will see what tonight looks like.

,Divorce,"My mom (70F) just came to my (36F) house with some odd texts she wanted to show me that my dad (66M) had sent her this morning. They've had a rough 38 years, he being a textbook narcissist, and she being the one that has just ""made herself scarce"" to avoid having to deal with him, especially recently. I'll spare you the details but from what she's telling me, it looks a lot like my dad is getting his ducks in a row to move forward with a divorce. 

My dad doesn't speak to my sister and brother in law, he has completely distanced himself from me (we used to talk several times a week...I haven't heard from him since the end of August and when I reach out, he's super short or just doesn't answer the phone) and he's been saying cryptic stuff to my mom. For example, he LOVES to entertain - takes over the kitchen, whips up amazing meals that people sing his praises over - and he texted her this morning that he ""expects her to be at dinner on Saturday because this is probably the last time we will entertain"". My mom is a little old school and likes to use cash and checks. They share all of their bank accounts and my dad told her to go get a debit card and open a credit card with a $X limit. He's been getting EXTREMELY angry at her over the last few months about things that should not be making him so crazy. 

It all smells a little fishy to me. I had her talk to a divorce lawyer today and the lawyer told her that these are signs that he's lining up to make some moves. I spoke to my mom this evening about looking deep inside of herself and deciding whether she would bring the divorce to him, instead of waiting for him to do it to her. She's really starting from Ground Zero so I am going to need to help her through this, but I don't think that a 70 year old woman should spend the rest of her days being treated like she's expendable. He's awful to her and makes her feel like she doesn't have a choice in the matter of her own life. The things that he says and does to her would make any woman, including me, tell her to ""Get the f\*\*\* away from that relationship"".

I&amp;#39;ll spare you the details but from what she&amp;#39;s telling me, it looks a lot like my dad is getting his ducks in a row to move forward with a divorce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad doesn&amp;#39;t speak to my sister and brother in law, he has completely distanced himself from me (we used to talk several times a week...I haven&amp;#39;t heard from him since the end of August and when I reach out, he&amp;#39;s super short or just doesn&amp;#39;t answer the phone) and he&amp;#39;s been saying cryptic stuff to my mom. For example, he LOVES to entertain - takes over the kitchen, whips up amazing meals that people sing his praises over - and he texted her this morning that he &amp;quot;expects her to be at dinner on Saturday because this is probably the last time we will entertain&amp;quot;. My mom is a little old school and likes to use cash and checks. They share all of their bank accounts and my dad told her to go get a debit card and open a credit card with a $X limit. He&amp;#39;s been getting EXTREMELY angry at her over the last few months about things that should not be making him so crazy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all smells a little fishy to me. I had her talk to a divorce lawyer today and the lawyer told her that these are signs that he&amp;#39;s lining up to make some moves. I spoke to my mom this evening about looking deep inside of herself and deciding whether she would bring the divorce to him, instead of waiting for him to do it to her. She&amp;#39;s really starting from Ground Zero so I am going to need to help her through this, but I don&amp;#39;t think that a 70 year old woman should spend the rest of her days being treated like she&amp;#39;s expendable. He&amp;#39;s awful to her and makes her feel like she doesn&amp;#39;t have a choice in the matter of her own life. The things that he says and does to her would make any woman, including me, tell her to &amp;quot;Get the f*** away from that relationship&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;m looking for some support, maybe some advice, maybe some &amp;quot;this happened to me too&amp;quot;, or maybe some kind words for me to pass onto my mom. I appreciate anything you can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"She's loved me since she was 15. I broke her heart at 17. When she was 20 she took me back and for the past 8 years, we've raised her daughter together as if she were mine.

For those 8 years she has stuck by me.

When I clearly didn't appreciate how much work a kid was, and all but failed at being a responsible parent, she swallowed her anger and stuck with me. She carried me as I hopped jobs. She carried me when I decided to quit a good job to go back to school. She carried me while I took my time catching up to being an adult.

And all the while, through all the hurt and exhaustion I put her through, she continued to tell me how much she loves me. She jokes that she doesn't have a choice. When I'm down she tells me how good of a heart I have. She tells me how I am the most handsome man she's ever seen and how I just keep getting better with age. She practically worships my existence even when she's so fed up with me that she wants to scream. We fight intensely and we love intensely.

Am I cleaning because it has to be done, or because I know she'll tell me to? 

Are we going on a date because I want to, or because we just fought about how we never go do anything?

Why am I so excited when she has to come home late, or when she decides to spend the weekend with our friends out of town? I could go, but someone has to watch the dog and the idea of an entire weekend alone is fantastic. 

And what do I do with 3 unsupervised days? Do I cheat on her? Use my freedom to stretch my legs? 

No, I wake up early. Actually cook breakfast. Get on my bike, or go for a run. Come home and cut the grass. Get the house spotless. Eat healthy. 

When she is not around, I am the best version of myself. 

Then she comes home and I'm exhausted just hearing the car pull up. I'm already anticipating an argument. Am I not happy enough to see her? How do I hide my disappointment that she's home? WHY am I disappointed? 

Today we argued and I had to force myself out the door and ended up taking the dog for a 2 hour walk. She walked away from me and I took the chance to sneak out, because if she had come back for one more word I would have snapped right there.

,Divorce,"Hi, hope this is ok on this sub. I’ve posted before on ‘relationships’ but there’s too many people on there that just want to make me paranoid, by saying she’s having an affair, when I know she isn’t! 

Anyway, to cut a long story short, together 14 years, married 9, 3 kids joint mortgage.  In April I got the ‘I love you but aren’t in love with you anymore’ speech from her, I was devastated, we held together until June, when she cracked and said we need to split. 

So we have been separated for about 4 months, it’s complete hell, but very amicable actually too amicable! Since the split every 2 weeks or so she seems to have a change of heart and will open up to me and drop all her feelings and emotions on me, we end up in bed together and have crazy passionate love making, in my eyes it’s a lot more than ‘sex with an ex’ and I’m pretty sure it is for her too by what she’s says after and then she will hold me all night long, she will still be ‘hot’ in the morning but then cold that evening so back to square one!

About a month ago I thought we had turned a corner when she called me late at night all emotional and said that for the last 2 weeks she realises she had made a huge mistake and wanted us to get back, and that she’s loves me so
much, naturally I went back but I asked if she just needed me for comfort or actually wanted me her reply was ‘ i want you, I want you for ever!’ Things were great for about 10 days then she just said she didn’t feel right again and that it was too soon so we needed to separate again!

I think it was too soon to, but my heart was broken again, 3rd time in 6 months.

Anyway back to the title since we’ve been split she has said/done the following things at various times...

I feel like I’ve lost my right arm by losing you

I’m missing you

Read our wedding ring sayings to me 

Asked me to go on holiday with her

Pictures of me still in her purse

Picture of me on her bedside table that moves from time to time 

Told me she’s confused

Told me she wishes she could turn back the clock

Cried her eyes out when I mention divorce 

Told me she not bothered if she still
Married to me in 20 years time

Told her bother she still loves me

Told me she still sort of loves me but doesn’t know exactly in what way

Had sex with me on at least 10 occasions, I’ve lost count! When we were married she never seemed that bothered! 

Videoed me on at kids bday party but not playing with the kids, just me

Showed me memes on her phone about if he’s on your mind he’s in your heart etc

Told me how sexy I look (don’t think she ever said this before!)

Suggested we could try again but live separately for a while.

Told me she’s scared and lost without me and totally torn between me and being single

And finally the most bizarre one was one night I came round to talk about splitting household possessions, she cooked me dinner and as we talked she held my hand, cuddled and kissed me and told me she just wanted to take me to bed, when it was time to go she burst out into tears.

Told me she’s addicted to me like a drug


And then today there’s now a picture of our wedding day on her bedside table as well!

But when she’s cold she will just say things like ‘I don’t want to give u false hope’ 🤯

I love this women to bits and I know she does me but is just confused by everything, obviously when she moves out I’m just hoping some time and space will reveal her true feelings and either way and give us both some clarity!

&lt;p&gt;And finally the most bizarre one was one night I came round to talk about splitting household possessions, she cooked me dinner and as we talked she held my hand, cuddled and kissed me and told me she just wanted to take me to bed, when it was time to go she burst out into tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Told me she’s addicted to me like a drug&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then today there’s now a picture of our wedding day on her bedside table as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when she’s cold she will just say things like ‘I don’t want to give u false hope’ 🤯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this women to bits and I know she does me but is just confused by everything, obviously when she moves out I’m just hoping some time and space will reveal her true feelings and either way and give us both some clarity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way thanks to anyone who has read all of this! Does this sound normal?&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce," This is going to be a lot…so grab some popcorn, a beer and make sure you have the energy to read the crap you’re about to read, haha. 

His background: 27 yrs old. Graduated valedictorian, but flunked out of prestigious university. Worked as a data analyst. His dad died from a heroin overdose, two days after his 6th birthday, and karate was one of the things his dad taught him, and one of the things that pulled him out his depression when he was little. His mom re-married quite a few times and moved all over with different boyfriends/husbands. Poor kid had no stability or parental roles. His mom was always working, so he basically raised himself with the help of his aunts and uncles. His mom acknowledges it now and is remorseful. His grandpa, who he was very close to, passed away when he was 17 and he and his uncle found him dead in his home. He’s gone through a lot of trauma. Yet through it all he remains a very gentle, sweet man. He hates social situations and is not great with communicating how he feels. He gets very excited and can talk forever about topics he loves. He’s very much “in his head” and seems like he has the world on his shoulders. Very loving and does whatever is asked of him. He’s just kind of a lost soul.

Me: Female. 26 years old. Raised by a borderline mother and have a borderline sister. Dad is not in the picture. Lived in one house until I was 18 (my grandma’s) with my mom, sister and grandma. I &lt;3 my grandma. I’ve struggled with anxiety, depression and weight issues all my life but I’ve always been very outgoing and was always the captain of sports and the leader of clubs in middle school / high school. I struggled academically because I was terribly organized and could never focus. It wasn’t until I was in my 20’s that I was diagnosed with ADHD. When I graduated high school I moved as far away as I could from the east coast to the west coast. I bounced around colleges in the west coast for a year until I finally settled down in Portland, OR. I loved Portland. I lived there for two years and ended up dating this guy for a little bit. It didn’t end too great and I ended up moving back home. 6-months later I met this guy on Imgur who lived close by. We connected right away and spent the entire summer together. We were both pretty young, dumb, damaged lost souls who fell in love, and started building a life together almost right away. We share the same sense of humor, goals, activities but were/are different enough that it’s not boring. We were both emotionally available and became very involved in one another’s lives. We definitely fell in a trap of co-dependency. I went through a bout of panic disorder with agoraphobia, a heart procedure, getting on anti-depressants, and just a lot of stuff. He was always there for me. He became my security blanket. I started intensive therapy to work through my family stuff and to manage panic disorder w. agoraphobia. As I started feeling better and outgoing again, I took on a business venture that would require us to move. I’ve always had an entrepreneurial spirit and was so excited about this business idea. But I still never really got into the “stuff” of therapy. Ykno, the fun deep-rooted past trauma shit. My therapy then was mainly coping mechanisms to overcome panic disorder, agoraphobia and dealing with my BPD mother and sister. I felt so good and normal again that I felt ready to take on the new business and new chapter of my life. I’ll never forget my therapist telling me that if I don’t really focus on my “stuff” (ADHD, weight, trauma, inner-child stuff) that my relationship and business will suffer. Eh, fuck it. I moved and started a business. Untreated ADHD in full swing! 

Well. 

We moved and it became all about the business. This is about 3 years into our relationship, and 1 yr of marriage. I definitely was not ready to start up a business and both of our  Our self-care and relationship went down the drain. We started couples counseling and he started focusing on his own mental health after a couple of breakdowns. He was diagnosed with bipolar, but then a mild form of autism. Schizophrenia runs in his family so that was on the doctor’s radar as well. He was bounced around between doctor’s and was put on some meds but stopped them abruptly about a year ago. I pointed out that I think we are too enmeshed and it might be good for him to get his own job, plus that’d be another source of income for us. He took up a job as a karate instructor and that became his life. He LOVED this job - kind of seemed like he was self-medicating with karate. Anyway, his bosses were hardly paying him minimum wage and were not paying him overtime. It’s a very cultish environment and I did not trust his bosses. They are very predatory and sketchy their students and staff. Because I had just started a business and his job was working him overtime but not paying for it, we were not able to make ends meet and got evicted and his car was repossessed. We were able to move somewhere else, this time with a roommate. But by then our relationship was holding on by a thread. We were not taking care of ourselves, finances were tight, we were both hyper focused on our jobs and couple’s counseling sessions were just bickering sessions. This time last year, his bosses invited me to a meeting to talk about the future. They gave him a raise, promotion and put him on “salary” of a take home of $350 week when he works 45+ hours. No benefits. They said they're opening up a third location in January 2019 and would like him to run it. There would be a higher pay, benefits, etc. I didn’t trust them to keep their word but hubby was SO thrilled that I kept my mouth shut. We were still struggling with finances and I had just wished he’d find a better paying job and just teach karate full-time. Eventually, I nagged him on this. We fought on this. I was relentless. I needed him to see how shitty this all was. But he didn’t seem to care. A few months later during his boss’s  Christmas party I found out that their plans for the third location fell through - no promotion. They so casually said this to the both of us. What hurt me the most is that hubby didn’t see the big deal. I was busting my ass running a business and getting a second job to make up for his part of the rent and take care of our dogs, car insurance, etc and he didn’t see the problem with the majority of the financial responsibility falling on me. I had HAD it. 

After the Christmas party, when we got home, I kicked him out of our bedroom, told him I needed to be with someone with their shit together and priorities in order and that we were free to see other people. I honestly was hoping this would be a wake up call for him. He did not want this and asked if we could still see the couple’s counselor. I said that doesn’t make any sense but I went along with it. She wasn’t too helpful and I just didn’t see the point. At this point, I wanted to be separated and one of us move out and just focus on ourselves, free to date, etc. He didn’t want that then. I had been casually hooking up with my roommate and on Tinder. I realized how fucked up I was being and started up individual counseling again to finally focus on my shit. In February I notice on the phone bill he’s talking to someone nonstop. I’m not stupid. I told him if we were going to do this then lets do this and come up with a game plan. He said that it was just a friend and avoided any attempts to sit down and come up with a separation plan. He then stopped coming home most nights and he’s dodging me. I knew what he was up to but of course he denied it. In March I suggested we work on our marriage but then he said he didn’t want to right now (but he still wanted to continue couples counseling?) and he just wanted some time and to focus on himself. At this point we’re only seeing each other in couples counseling despite living under the same roof. In April I suggest we see another counselor and that counselor was actually really fantastic. He was in-line with Mort Fertels techniques and we started getting close again. But I had a gut feeling he was still talking to this girl and I wanted him to admit it. So I called him out on it and he started avoiding me completely. Dodged texts, calls, emails. Stood me up for couples counseling and stopped coming home completely. He stopped contributing anything financially. In May he stopped coming home completely. End of May I see on the girls Facebook a picture of them together. I email him to come pick-up his shit and to get the hell out. I reach out to her to let her know she’s dating a married man and she tells me she had no idea and that they’ve been “Very romantic” since February and that they’re so in love. 

He’s been moved out since June and they’re still dating. I was more upset with the fact that he lied to me. He had the green light to move out, date and live his life. But he lied and gaslit me and our therapists. I can’t even tell you how much it was brought up in therapy that I need to not be so “suspicious” about this girl and trust him more. When he moved out, it was very silent and heavy. He didn't acknowledge the other woman to me at all, even still. Through all of this, the worst thing he said to me was that he’s better off without me. I don’t disagree. I also don’t agree. I think we’re both better off without that version of ourselves. He also said he felt I pushed him out of my life. First out of the business, then out of our room, and then out of my life. He’s onboard to go through with divorce if I am but he made it clear he’s not going to be the one to initiate. He just wants to do his own thing right now. And that thing does not involve me in anyway, shape or form. They’re “Facebook official” but his social medias still has me plastered everywhere. Nothing of her whatsoever except for the “in a relationship” with part, that he has hidden on his end, but is public on her page. She’s very lovey dovey on her Facebook. He does not post on his social media. From a strangers standpoint, it’d look like we were still together. I don’t think this means anything, but it does give me a chuckle. 

Anyway, I realize I brought this mostly onto myself. I don’t hate him for dating, but I’m mad at how he went about it. I understand that we’re young and fucked up and just figuring out who we are. Or, I am at least.I realized when I called for the separation I was largely projecting. I wanted to be someone with my shit together. But I’m sad. I miss him dearly and I wish I had gotten my shit together before we met or while we were together. I hate that it took us to get to this place to be the kick in the ass I needed. I’ve been doing a lot of inner-work through therapy, working out, yoga and meditation. Even if he were to ask for us to be together right now, it’s just not the time. This is the time for me and I’m thoroughly enjoying it. I’m only 26 and it’s been nice to learn about myself, heal and grow in all aspects of my life. But then the sinking anxiety sets in sometimes: What does the future look like? Is he going to be with her forever? Did he ever love me in the first place? Will we ever get back together? Why doesn’t he talk to me? Doesn’t he miss our dogs, our home, our life? Why didn’t he fight for us? How did he move on so fast? I’ve been pausing, acknowledging my fears, cry if I have to and let it go and just focus on the moment. I have a lot to work on myself that I’m not even close to being in a relationship of any sort. I do hope one day we may find our way back to each other again, but I think that’s a far off time. And that’s okay. 

Does anyone else have any messy endings? This was so slow, drawn out and painful, but nothing was even said really. It just kind of fizzled?

,Divorce,"Upfront: this account is a throw away I created for this post. I am hoping for feedback to help me decide how to proceed. I read the sticky posts before posting and will try to follow the rules.  I deeply appreciate any one takes the time to read this and respond. 

Edit: I'm sorry this is so long. There's a tldr at the end. 

Background stuff:
Age: me- 32 STBX- 34
Kids: 1 (8 years old)
Marriage length: 9 years (dated for 3 years prior)
Did we go to counseling: yes, we saw a marriage counselor for a few months
Did we use a mediator: yes, we sat down with a family focused mediator and created a mutually agreed upon parenting plan and situation agreement. 

Details and status: ok, so based on the background stuff this probably seems fairly straight forward,  unfortunately it is not. I am going to try to lay everything out with out being skewed about my interpretation,  but to be frack, I am very frustrated and exhausted. 

My and my STBX have been married for 9 years.  Some were good, some were bad.  We almost separated 4 years in,  but she insisted we stay together and ultimately we did.  There were some good time after that,  but some where in the 6th year I decided that we needed to separate.  This was not a snap decision and lead to long arguments that lasted many months. Neither me nor my STBX are physically abusive in any way,  but the emotional toll this interaction took on both of us was (and still is) huge.  The crux of the situation was,  I said I wanted a divorce,  and she said no.  

When she was upset she became aggressive and emotionally abusive often holding me in conversations with threats of self harm,  or other destructive action if I simply left. There are many reasons I did not simply leave, most of them are related to our son.  Simply put,  I could depend on her to care for him and I could not kick her out. 

(Let me pause and say that I fully understand that there are many thing I now realize I could have done at every step that would have been better. I tried my best to determine what would be best for everyone involved. I never thought it would continue like this.)

After months of fighting (I honestly don't how many) she said I would no longer discuss or relationship with out a mediator. Eventually she agreed to sit down with a marriage counselor instead of fighting.  We started seeing the marriage counselor in November of 2017 after waiting 3 months for counselor that she selected to have availability. We're saw that counselor every other week for four months. In that time,  very little was discussed. She skipped about half of the sessions, starting they weren't helping,  and detailed positive conversations when she did attend. This was hard.  By February 2018 we stopped going and set a hard date for us to separate. Our lease was up in August of 2018 and I started that I would be finding a new place to live. It was my goal to find an affordable place, in  good school district, close to family support. I found a place about a month before moving day. She did not look.  She spent six full months fighting with me and was not prepared to move.  

(2nd pause she is an extremely intelligent person with a technical background who is capable of securing a significant salary with a phone call, should she choose to do so. Instead she works as a consultant billing roughly 40 hours per month. About $2500 in monthly income.) 

She attempted to move into the condo I found when we moved.  I said no and after a few weeks of couch surfing she started renting a room from a mutual friend.  That was over a year ago and the living/ work situation has not changed. I have a condo down the street from my son's school,  she rents a room from a friend about 25 min away. She has tried to get me to put a bed in the other room in the condo many times, I will not as I am sure she will simply start living there if I do. 

Several more months pass,  still lots of fighting,  emotional breaking points,  the crux remains the same I want a divorce,  she says no. I try to get her to see a mediator, and so we can resolve things,  she refuses. Even agreeing and then not showing up a few times. Eventually I decide to see a lawyer. It is only at this point that she agrees says she will with with a mediator.  The one I found was great. They were family focused,  non-biased, friendly,  well reviewed,  professional,  and (ofcourse) expressive.  At this point I didn't care.  I knew that a court room contested divorce would be more expressive and only hurt our son. We went and created a parenting plan. This parenting plan is the actual topic of this post.  It was created in February of 2019.

Here are the parenting plan details:
Child custody: our child sleeps at my house on all school nights,  and for one week end per month.  He stays with his mother one the other three weekends.  (Note: he has only stayed at her house 2 or 3 times because he doesn't have a room or bed there. )
Money: -she pays for aftercare and splits school and kid related expenses.
-I pay: her student loans,  her credit card (only past charges), and her car until payed off
off
-I pay her insurance (medical and auto) and cell phone for 2 years.  

- we each pay our own rent.  My car is mine,  her car is her's and there are no other major assets. 

Oooohhhhh! I almost forgot: she didn't pay any taxes for 3 years of 1099 work.  I agreed to split that debt.


Ok so,  unless I am way disconnected from reality,  she recieved the absolute best possible divorce agreement one can be offered. She has very few parental obligations,  and most of get major financial needs are met. I agreed to all of this because at this point I simply wanted out.  I was exhausted and thought that if she was taken care of, maybe.... maybe she would sign and agree to move on. 

That did not happen.  For the next six months she alternated between telling me would get everything notarized next week,  ignoring the fact that paperwork existed,  and telling me she would never sign. Any time I would bring up the paper work it would result in another fight. If I ignored it too, things were spittle easier,  so... we made it to August (3 weeks ago) before I finally broke down and called my lawyer again.  This had to stop. 

In taking to my lawyer they assured me that a filing with out an agreed upon plan was actually the typical process and that I had waited long enough.  We talked about the parenting plan as it stood and they asked if I would make any changes should we continue with out her signature on the previous document. I said yes. I want to cut the financial support and state she must have a bed for our son to sleep in if he stays with her.  She agreed 100% that those changes were warranted and a judge would agree.  She even asked if I wanted to pursue child support.  I said no.  I have no desire to hurt or financially cripple my STBX, I'm just sick of being weighed down with nothing positive in response. She says that because there is more involved,  I need to increase my retainer to continue.  That is fine.  It was expected,  but I wanted wait until the 1st of October before I moved the money out of my account. That was last week. 


Fast forward to Monday the 30th. 6 months after the separation agreement was drafted,  almost 3 years since I told my wife I was done,  and one day before I payed the lawyer to draft a new document and have her served. Zero guilt at this point,  she had every chance and refused to proceed.  

... Monday night she left the paper work on my counter.  Signed and notarized.  


So choice time: (also the TLDR)

Do I proceed with a parenting plan that financially supports my STBX even though she made me wait months for her to sign it or do I pay the lawyer to file with out it and tell her she waited to long.",t2_4py6n8wm,False,,0,False,Advice requested after two years of trying to separate.,[],r/Divorce,False,1,,0,False,t3_dcvb4n,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,,1570129925.0,,[],[],{},,True,,1570157707.0,text,1,,text,self.Divorce,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upfront: this account is a throw away I created for this post. I am hoping for feedback to help me decide how to proceed. I read the sticky posts before posting and will try to follow the rules.  I deeply appreciate any one takes the time to read this and respond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;m sorry this is so long. There&amp;#39;s a tldr at the end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background stuff:
Age: me- 32 STBX- 34
Kids: 1 (8 years old)
Marriage length: 9 years (dated for 3 years prior)
Did we go to counseling: yes, we saw a marriage counselor for a few months
Did we use a mediator: yes, we sat down with a family focused mediator and created a mutually agreed upon parenting plan and situation agreement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details and status: ok, so based on the background stuff this probably seems fairly straight forward,  unfortunately it is not. I am going to try to lay everything out with out being skewed about my interpretation,  but to be frack, I am very frustrated and exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My and my STBX have been married for 9 years.  Some were good, some were bad.  We almost separated 4 years in,  but she insisted we stay together and ultimately we did.  There were some good time after that,  but some where in the 6th year I decided that we needed to separate.  This was not a snap decision and lead to long arguments that lasted many months. Neither me nor my STBX are physically abusive in any way,  but the emotional toll this interaction took on both of us was (and still is) huge.  The crux of the situation was,  I said I wanted a divorce,  and she said no.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she was upset she became aggressive and emotionally abusive often holding me in conversations with threats of self harm,  or other destructive action if I simply left. There are many reasons I did not simply leave, most of them are related to our son.  Simply put,  I could depend on her to care for him and I could not kick her out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Let me pause and say that I fully understand that there are many thing I now realize I could have done at every step that would have been better. I tried my best to determine what would be best for everyone involved. I never thought it would continue like this.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After months of fighting (I honestly don&amp;#39;t how many) she said I would no longer discuss or relationship with out a mediator. Eventually she agreed to sit down with a marriage counselor instead of fighting.  We started seeing the marriage counselor in November of 2017 after waiting 3 months for counselor that she selected to have availability. We&amp;#39;re saw that counselor every other week for four months. In that time,  very little was discussed.

,Divorce,"Hello,

My wife and I split in March of this year and since then she has filed for a divorce under adultery reasons (I moved on after a couple of months).

We've been through mediation and have come up with a verbal agreement on how we will be splitting assets, finances, child payments etc. I have no issues here..

Back at the start of September we had our decree nisi pronounced and passed without issue - this now leaves around 3 weeks left before my STBXW can apply for our decree absolute.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a little worried as we have not yet had our consent order / clean break document written up. I only had a call with my solicitor last night to kick things off and have been advised that the timeframes for this can be anywhere up to 10 weeks.

My questions are:

1 - Does the consent order need to be in place and have been through court before the decree absolute can be requested?

2 - Im aware of the risks of having the absolute in place without an approved consent order, but should I really be that worried?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, after a call with my solicitor last night, I spoke with my STBXW about the consent order and she has suggested that we don't actually need one any more because we have agreed everything ourselves.. This is a red flag for me as it means there is the potential there for her to change her mind in the future and go back on our agreements. I will be pushing back (and paying for..) the consent order to be processed and put before the courts, but I cant think of any reason why she would suggest not having one in place outside of her trying to save me some cash.

&amp;#x200B;

,Divorce,"My STBXH and I met for the first time in two months Saturday to negotiate the terms of the divorce. It was...rough. He came in with so many preconceptions that I was going to “screw him over” on the money and was hostile and bitter. After I left the room crying, he finally calmed down once our therapist pointed out I was trying very hard to be fair and nice and didn’t deserve the attitude. Eventually he understood the importance to me of keeping the house we built together and he agreed to a 55% split in my favor, with the rest of his accounts intact. He agreed on my proposed valuation of the house, which I also tried to be very fair in, considering the house is not fully renovated and comps in our area are difficult. By the end of negotiations, we were both calm and conciliatory, and things felt ok. He did admit to seeing someone else already, which id already suspected. He was confused about his feelings for her, for me. He said he didn’t know if he still believes he never loved me,  that he knows he really wanted to, that he knows there were happy times, that he looks at photos of us and....he trailed off and never finished the thought, asking our therapist if it was even helping to talk about those things. I was broken the rest of the weekend thinking about what he was going to say next. We leave without a hug. 

Two days later, he texts me saying he’s a bit bothered by the agreement, that he thinks the valuation is 35k higher based on Zillow and Redfin, and he thinks I know the agreement was financially unfair but he wants acknowledgment, if not appreciation, that he is not fighting me on this and is working hard to try to keep the house that I want.  That he knows he screwed me over emotionally but hopes one day I will see he never meant to hurt me as much as he did. That he hopes I will bounce back soon and live a fulfilling life. 

I invited him to my therapy session tonight to talk about it more, wanting to make sure he felt heard even though I disagreed that anything I asked for was unfair in any way. He declined, saying he said everything he wanted to say, that he was looking for appreciation on his efforts on the house, but guess he wasn’t going to get it and it was just another case of not seeing eye to eye. He then moved on to asking me to tell him when I file the divorce papers this week as planned and a question about a contractor. 

I told him I did appreciate the efforts on the house, that we built that home together and it’s one of the many reasons it means a lot to me to keep it. That it also does mean a lot to me that he’s working with me to keep it. That I didn’t want this, I was happy, I love him. And I told him I would be filing today.

So I’m filing today. I spent three hours crying about it last night. A friend drove over to my house to just sit and hug me while I did. After all this, I love him so much and I know he’s hurting and I know it doesn’t even come close to touching how much I’m hurting.

,Divorce,"My STBXW and I have two kids (8.5 and 11) and this means there is a fair amount of needed communication.  We are also still finalizing our separation agreement (surprise!  the stuff about money is the hardest part!!) . We have not filed yet.  At any rate with two kids theres a lot back of forth about school, soccer games, what clothes they need, medicine, doctor's appts, etc etc.  But I'm trying to limit the amount of communication and, even more, the amount of time we need to be in the same.  Things have been mostly amicable and we did pretty well last year (she asked for a divorce on 9/15/18 and I moved out on 11/15/18) and it's fine for most part, but I'd really rather not be around her, truth be told.  And I don't want to text.  She's been good about keeping it transactional (to the point where she is almost cold) and I don't think she has any great desire to be around me.  That said, she can take it or leave b/c she is over/done and has no emotional pain (she initiated and like any walkaway wife she was GONE before she even said ""divorce"").  

I am choosing not to go to some school type events over the next couple weeks.  I'd rather be with the kids or work late or workout than go to yet another school parent's cocktail event.  None of these are events that the kids will be at. Those I never miss and last school year we sat together (in the auditorium) but I'm not sure that's even needed.  I don't dislike her and haven't really felt anger (part of the issue that, despite al the work I've done, there are still actual feelings) and I am trying to be kind and compassionate as a co parent.  But I also just feel it's okay for me to limit contact and time spent with her.

On the other hand is that avoiding reality?  Is that a form of denial? Of hiding from pain?  I'm not really hiding from the pain and feelings I have about the divorce, but standing next to the woman I was once committed to is not the easiest thing or maybe the best thing for me.  We will of course be together for kid's bdays and we have gone out to dinner altogether in the last few months and all that.  It will happen.

So, we're trying to do a dissolution. Which means we need to agree 100% on everything.

My problem is, idk if she'll agree on spousal support.
With bonus and stock options she makes about $75,000 a year. I'm at about $32,000. I was only going to ask for $650 to cover the mortgage. She's going to live with her sister and probably have no bills, other than her car, and I'll be stuck with all the bills. 

Without support I fear I'll be in financial ruin.

,Divorce,"My future ex wife told me she wanted a divorce two days ago. It hit me like a freight train. I knew we had been in a rough patch for the past year or so but I personally thought we were getting through it. She had papers ready 24 hours after telling me. She told me she hasn't been in love with me for over a year and had no attraction to me either. That cut me to the core. 

We have two kids, our daughter will be 4 and our son will be 1 next month. My daughter is starting to notice the changes and its shattering my heart. We agreed upon splitting everything 50/50 but she wants primary legal custody instead of joint legal. She got a little heated when I told her i wouldn't settle for anything less than full joint custody. Everything else was so simple to agree upon than that. I agreed to just pay daycare costs as child support and assist with everything else as needed. 

I work 3rd shift and after work I come ""home"" and let the dogs out again after she takes the kids to daycare. I then go to my friends place to sleep, i get 3-4 hours a day and can't sleep more than that. I get up at 2-2:30, get the kids from daycare and bring them ""home"" and just take in as much time with them as possible.

I then leave and go to my friends house again until i leave for work. This ""schedule"" is so draining but if it means that much time with my kids I'll survive.

I, 40M, have been married to my wife 43F for 7 years and been together for 10 years.  We've had our ups and downs probably due to me being a little complacent in the relationship and her with some unrealistic expectations of marriage/relationships.  Lack of effort on both our parts. We have been in counseling very infrequently for a couple years but things have been the worst since February.  We have a 6 year old child.  We also run a business together - you get the point.

Last night in our first appointment with a new counselor (which I found - she hasn't done anything to improve us). It went poorly, especially for me.  She said everything I do bothers her and she can't remember why she's with me or any good qualities.   Whereas I made it clear that I still love her and wanted to work things out.  She said she has lost respect for me and has checked out of the relationship since FEBRUARY!  That was already clear from the lack of intimacy of any kind for the last few months.  She was a mess of tears - the only thing that shows she has any desire to work things out was the fact that she came to the appointment on time.  She has an individual appointment on Friday with the same guy for her to vent and for him to evaluate.

She told me that she would feel ""safer"" if she was able to take the entire joint savings account ($10k+) and hold onto it. I agreed.

She wanted joint legal custody but her to have primary physical custody. OK, I agreed.

A few weeks ago, my STBX got pissy because she saw on our still joined finances that I went to see my (our) therapist. She concocted a narrative whereby that was me going to build up courage to serve her with divorce papers.

She followed up by asking that I leave the therapist behind because ""it's too hard for her to have the same therapist."" 

You know what? I wanted to keep the peace so I said sure. Actually, what I said was that I wasn't quitting therapy cold turkey and it isn't like I have a therapist lined up to take the place of my current one so I would go to my therapist, ask for referrals and talk about how to transition out.

My STBX threw a hissy fit that I ""don't tell her anything"" because she didn't know I have an upcoming appointment.

I could only laugh. I was super calm as I told her that her controlling bullshit was done and wasn't going to work on me any more. Keep the therapist. Keep the art. Keep the whatever other petty shit you felt the need to hang on to. Stand by, you're getting fucking served. See you in court. No more communication unless by text and only about childcare.

I'm fucking done. I tried to do this in a way that was not traumatic for us and our child. I tried to do it in a way that won't destroy our finances. This bandaid, however, needs to be ripped off. 

Fortunately for me, separation agreement aside, I have documented domestic violence on her part and I'm legally entitled to half of her 401(k) as I sacrificed the better part of my youth in shitty jobs because we were following her career.

Our marriage was great and we wanted so badly to become parents that we did IVF and were blessed with boy/girl twins. He was the most amazing man during that difficult time and all through the pregnancy but we started to drift as the struggles of two newborns hit us, his mother became such a problem that he got a restraining order against her, and he turned to the bottle and away from me.

He went to a 28 day in patient rehab facility in February and wanted to repair our marriage the entire time in there. I was terrified for him to come straight home and was thrilled when he brought up a sober living house to further help him recover. He went there from rehab and it was like a switch flipped. he thought I was horrible for not begging him to come home and suddenly decided divorce was the best thing we could do. 

I had threatened divorce numerous times prior to rehab to protect me and the kids, but it was never what I wanted. I wanted my devoted loving husband back, not this alcoholic mess that he had become.

,Divorce,"So after 11 years of marriage, I decided I had had enough. This was not a sudden or rash decision. My husband has always been very emotionally distant and unsupportive, to a point where his words and actions have seriously harmed me.  He is VERY involved in what he wants to do/has to do. He prefers to be by himself and has a difficult to impossible time connecting in any meaningful way with others - myself, his son from previous marriage, our son together, his family (esp mom  - has no relationship with her except MAYBE 1x a year - no holidays or birthday connection).  He is kind of on the order of schizoid personality disorder. Not extreme but has all the markings of someone in this category. His mom lives alone, I think is a hoarder (but she never asked us into her house the one time we saw her there), and I think *her* mom had some mental health issues and was raised by another family member, not her mother. So, maybe some of this stems from that?

I decided that I wanted a separation and divorce. I told him up front. He seemed mildly annoyed, etc. He went abroad for a week to do something for pleasure/a hobby  (by himself).  While he was gone, my son and I had a good time, got things rolling for school, for a routine, etc. Now he is back, and I am so stressed.

To top it off, my son is now shutting down. He has been this way for about 9-10 months. I think my stress and his father's disengaged personality is taking a toll. He seems uninterested in school, though he is a very good student. He is at a new school and struggling with attention and focus and organization. This was a kid who was funny, light hearted, loved life, etc. and was very upbeat. We went to his counselor yesterday who said, ""I miss the old kid."" It's true - that kid is not there right now. It's heart wrenching.

SO...I have two choices - I can either move out as I planned and we share custody, or I stay for 6 more years to see my kid (hopefully) out to school/college. My husband and I have tried therapy - I truly do NOT think that it helped, that he feels he has any larger issues, or that the way he acts is strange. Others see it, for sure. It is affecting my son, and me, and I am not the best person I could be. I am depressed, anxious and very very unhappy.

So, maybe some of this stems from that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided that I wanted a separation and divorce. I told him up front. He seemed mildly annoyed, etc. He went abroad for a week to do something for pleasure/a hobby  (by himself).  While he was gone, my son and I had a good time, got things rolling for school, for a routine, etc. Now he is back, and I am so stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To top it off, my son is now shutting down. He has been this way for about 9-10 months. I think my stress and his father&amp;#39;s disengaged personality is taking a toll. He seems uninterested in school, though he is a very good student. He is at a new school and struggling with attention and focus and organization. This was a kid who was funny, light hearted, loved life, etc. and was very upbeat. We went to his counselor yesterday who said, &amp;quot;I miss the old kid.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s true - that kid is not there right now. It&amp;#39;s heart wrenching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO...I have two choices - I can either move out as I planned and we share custody, or I stay for 6 more years to see my kid (hopefully) out to school/college. My husband and I have tried therapy - I truly do NOT think that it helped, that he feels he has any larger issues, or that the way he acts is strange. Others see it, for sure. It is affecting my son, and me, and I am not the best person I could be. I am depressed, anxious and very very unhappy. Several years ago I got VERY sick (cancer), and I thought, life is NOT WORTH being uphappy. But here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HELP!!&lt;/p&gt;

My husband was 26 years old, 7 years older than me.  He had never dated and was still a virgin. He was uncomfortable with any intimacy.  When we did have sex he responded with shame.  We dated for 4 years before we got married.  I thought that I could love him through his discomfort with intimacy and he would get comfortable.  He didn't.  I thought he was gay.  He wasn't.  I thought he may have had sexual trauma.  He didn't.  I thought he was asexual.  He says he isn't.  He said he would feel more comfortable after marriage (he's not religious).  He wasn't.  

He was very controlling for the first 15 years of our relationship.  Especially about money.  But he also criticized how I spoke, my home, my family.  He told me what I could order when we went out to eat.  Every purchase was subjected to his scrutiny.  I could not work enough, not spend enough or save enough for him.  I was never worth any extra expense. 

I have to take responsibility for my part of this failing marriage.  Until 5 years ago, I never said anything.  I never taught him to treat me better.  I was codependent and couldn't be ok with myself unless he was ok with me... which was never. 

We saw countless therapists and doctors for his intimacy problems.  We learned that he has an attachment disorder and his prefrontal cortex (reasoning part of the brain) is not fully formed.  He cannot talk out a problem.  No issue has ever been solved in 21 years. It is useless to try. 

9 years ago he lost his job...not through his fault.  He already suffered with low self esteem and confidence.  This took what little he had.  He said he wanted to farm. So, I bought him a farm. He stayed home with our 4, amazing kids.  He flourished as a Father. It was the first time I ever saw him really human. He became less controlling, but still struggled with it at a lesser level.  

I asked for a divorce 3 years ago after he would not go back to work.  I had to pick up a second, very stressful job.  I worked 70 hours a day, averaging 3 days off a month...for 4 YEARS. I missed almost every child's sporting event, parent/teacher conference and milestone during that time.  I begged, pleaded, cried and got angry when he could see how much I was hurting but would not get a job. When I asked for the divorce he cried and said he would do better.  Three years later...no job.  No intimacy. He has improved in his understanding of his mental health.  However, it hadn't changed how selfish he is daily.  

I told him 3 weeks ago that I was going forward with the divorce.  He cried and said he would do better.  He filled out several job applications and started seeing a therapist again.  It just feels too little too late.

It's given me time to think about what I really want..

We have a 5 year old child together and it makes me sick to think about how this will hurt him/her. But, living my life with STBXH for eternity makes me just a bit more sick. He is a great person, very funny and intelligent, cares about me deeply, has a great job, etc. Don't think he has ever had an affair, physically anyways. I'm definitely not physically attracted to him anymore, I still see him as that 15 year old and it makes shudder every time we have sex. Yes, we still have sex because I have been acting like nothing is wrong and have been leading him on. I know, it's terrible and wrong but I don't want to give him any ideas until it's the right time.

More than anything I need an emotional connection with someone on a higher level. He will be devastated and this will probably ruin his life if he allows it. We have absolutely no connection emotionally and for me, I have never slept with another man and constantly fantasize about doing so. In my opinion, this is completely natural considering the circumstances. I want to experience life, date, be kissed by other men, feel like I'm wanted/desired, and have the single life I never did. He will be completely devastated when I tell him. I have had these feelings for years, but just recently came up with the courage due to other events that have happened to our family this year. Thing that makes me feel insanely guilty is how he has mentioned that he would probably go into a deep dark depression and drink himself to death if something ever happened to us. He has a strong family history of alcoholism. Hope he is just saying this to scare me but who knows. I won't allow his fears to control my life and happiness. 

We have been to counseling because I told him how emotionally disconnected he is from everything. I think this process solidified my reasons for leaving. He got a little better during the process but then went right back to being shut-off afterwards. There is nothing he can say or do at this point.

Also think he has interactions with bosses/co-workers/friends that makes me wonder if he is having an emotional affair. He may be connecting with them since I have exhausted all of my energy trying to connect with him.

,Divorce,"Hello, I’m working on a child custody and visitation schedule with my lawyer. My stbx is going to have the kids every other weekend and 1 weeknight for dinner. Not sure how it will work for the holidays. If he has them for Thanksgiving, does that mean I usually get them for all of Christmas? Can I just drop the kids off on Thanksgiving Day? I was also wondering, am I able to prevent my girls from having sleepovers at their cousins house when they are with Dad?

I'm a tech person that has built many intelligent systems with pattern recognition and machine learning in my day and I've found myself in a multi-year divorce process where the other party is ticking off the boxes of a malicious parent and taking advantage of the system in every possible way.

If you don't have a network of divorced/divorcing contacts in your area then you are often an easy target, internet searches often result in generic or outdated legal blogs, and posting your details to an online message board can be quite risky to you come trial.

,Divorce,"I think most of us know that the whole ""5 stages of grief"" thing is bullshit. Okay, so maybe not complete BS, but it doesn't happen in any order, and it can very much jump back and forth between the stages. At least this is how it was for me the first 3 months after separating from my STBX. And up until only maybe 2 or 3 weeks ago, I really thought I was recovering. These 'ups and downs' were becoming less intense and seemed to be stabilizing and I felt confident and in a pretty good place.   


Now fast forward 2 weeks and I feel appalling. For the life of me, I cannot think of anything that might have triggered this. Yes, I do suffer from anxiety and depression, but the intensity of how numb I feel is scaring me: It feels different this time. I have never experienced so many suicidal thoughts. I know I wont act on them (I love my cats too much and just lack the courage to go through with it) but they are almost constantly there and really bother me. They make my anxiety spike, and so that feeds this whole cycle that repeats over and over again. And the worst thing of all is that I don't feel like I can talk to friends or family about it because they will just panic and might send the cops around again. I mean, sure I completely understand why, but it just means I feel that I have to bottle a lot of this up. Posting here is the only way I can really vent about it.   


The thing is that I feel like I was doing everything right: Exercising more? Yes. I've actually lost a lot of weight. Very little body fat left. I felt good about this, but now...numb. Eating right. I'm sure that's probably helped. Asked a couple of women out (albeit very casually), with positive results. Therapy? Yeah it's always helped in the past but lately feels like a waste of time. Work/life balance? Really good. Threw myself into starting a new business and it continues going from strength to strength.   


All in all even when I am laughing my ass off and my business is doing really well or I am scuba diving (I live in a small town near a pristine coral reef, a 10 minute walk from my house...) everything just feels empty. It feels like I only have 2 speeds: numb or anxious. It's like I can see myself laughing but it's not actually me. It's like I am going through the paces and there is only so much ""gym time"", ""eating right"" and ""keeping busy"" can really do for me.

,Divorce,"A year ago my ex and I were living together in our dream house, trying to work together to prep it for sale when we could barely talk to each other. I was in agony; she was screaming at me daily, telling me what a horrible person I was, that everything that had ever gone wrong in our relationship was my fault, and that nobody would ever love me again. All this while she was having an affair with the guy I still naively believed was our friend. My daughter was in tears and I was in Hell.

Tonight, as I type this, I’m safe in my own home with nobody telling me that I’m dirt. My daughter is spending half her time with me, half her time with her mom, is doing well at school, and has lots of friends. She’s happy that there’s no fighting anymore. My ex and I are pretty much no-contact and I’m fine with that.

I have good friends, lots of hobbies, plenty of good books and an annoying cat.

,Divorce,"Hello Reddit,

**The TL:DR portion is at the bottom.  I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and genuinely helps me out.**

I've been wanting to write here for a while, but just never really had the time to write...but I am in more of a quandry.

So my wife has a few issues, undiagnosed asperger's syndrome, generalized anxiety disorder, and she has a substance abuse problem with alcohol.  We hit our anniversary earlier in the summer.  We both thought it would be a good idea to have an open marriage.  I wanted to swing, she wanted a poly lifestyle.  The person that introduced us to the lifestyle was a snake who exploited the fact that my wife sees the good in everyone and got her so enraptured with him, that she started disrespecting me and essentially carrying on a relationship with this dude when I specifically told her, no emotional involvement, only sex.  And no I am not a cuck.  Since this 3rd party is a substance abuse counselor, he used his psychology to have my wife dependent on him because I do not have an addictive personality, but he is a former pothead and alcoholic and she is an alcoholic herself.  When I tried to stand up for myself and tell her to stop doing certain things that would hurt me, she continued or stopped for the meanwhile, then complained to the dude that I was so controlling and I didn't allow her to do anything.  Fast forwarding to the mid summer, she lost her job and then the heavy drinking commenced.

On our anniversary, she came to the conclusion that she felt like she had a husband and a bf.  I scoffed and I told her I could have told you that.  She told me to recall the chain of events that got us to where we are.  So I told her how I saw things going downhill, she started to stonewall and shut down.  I needed her at that time to verbalize why she was shutting down because I am so tired of explaining things...she'll clearly know my side of the story, but I never ever get a chance to know her side of things, which essentially I feel checkmated.  I got enraged because for the last 3 years when she's under duress, she'll clam up.  I wanted answers and I cursed her out and told her about herself.  She felt unsafe and then she ran out of the house, 

Fast forwarding a few weeks later, her drinking got so bad, I had to call the cops on her because I thought they would force her to go to the hospital and get help.  They did nothing.  I stayed in a hotel for a night. Fast forwarding more, she was drunk to the point that she called the cops on me.  I was arrested and held in jail for two days.  In my state, even if the victim says i don't want to press charges, if the state deems it necessary, you're still going to jail.  It was the worst experience of my life.  I had to leave the home that I've called home for 4 years and move in with my toxic family members.  But at least they were there for me to have a place to come home to.  

My family and I hired a lawyer and we had the case dismissed.  My wife came in and told the judge that things got out of control and she did not want to go further with anything.  Even though I was angry for a very very long time, I lost my job, I essentially lost my marriage, I lost everything, I still forgave her.  My entire family hates her guts. (They told me from the very beginning that it was something off about her) Ever since the no contact order has been lifted, we have been very amicable, and we have even met up where she apologized about a lot of things and how she knows that she was not a good wife to me and she is so sorry for what she done.  She is trying so hard to get me back, and I know that I want to remain friendly, but I don't want to be married anymore.  This whole situation has me mentally wanting to just focus on myself and recoup all that I lost.  However, I know when I finally tell her that I want the divorce, I feel like I am going to be manipulated with tears and her low self esteem and crying out you don't want me...All I ever wanted was to love you, etc. etc.  

For the last couple of years, every time she got pissed at me she threw up divorce, I begged her to stay, when she had a mental episode and was in the hospital, I stayed...now this?!?!  But now since she wants to try to mend things, I don't want to.  Again, I want to always know that she's doing well.  I can be a friend pushing her in the direction of doing great things...but as a husband, no.  I can't do it anymore.  

**TL:DR:  How do I go about telling a person that is emotionally unstable that I don't want to be married to them anymore without them threatening their own life as they've done so many times in the past (even though they never actually did it) especially now since we're amicable even though we're separated.**",t2_44hi5hgl,False,,0,False,"Want to get a divorce, but genuinely scared to do it officially.",[],r/Divorce,False,1,,0,False,t3_dc458p,False,light,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Getting Started,False,1,,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1570012549.0,text,1,,text,self.Divorce,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"trigger: self harm

I filed in August of last year. We had gone to counseling and the counselor was constantly trying to get her to engage, to say something, to try to work on things. We both spoke, we both gave our sides, and it was obvious that she needed to step up to the plate. But she took no responsibility for anything. She claimed she had done nothing wrong. She blamed it all on my choice to leave her. She would go on to see a private therapist our counselor recommended and one day told me she felt all my anger and disgust at what she had done constituted abuse. When both of us were in the room, it required honesty and she knew her part made her look bad. When she was alone, she could warp things into whatever she wanted. When I filed, we had a 6-month old son, we had been fighting for almost a year over finances and trust issues, I was at the end of my rope and stupidly, almost ended my life in an intense moment. I went absolutely no contact with my STBXW and have only talked to her about our son since then.

September 2019, my divorce finalized. It was a year of lawyers going back and forth about every pedantic little thing. Splitting Christmas day, invasive right of first refusal, requiring updates on my mental health. Through it all, I never got riled up. I had reached the blackest bottom and it didn't end me. She would continue to sling accusations my way, posting ridiculous things on Facebook, going to her family and manipulating validation out of mistruths. She could sling arrows, lie to her friends, try to get digs in on me. It just rolled off my back. I knew what I had to do and that she would have no part in it. I would have to make life better for myself and my son without her.

I am here to tell you all, sit down, figure out what you have to do to change YOU, not them, and you will get to the most wonderful place. I have 50/50 custody of my son, I found an amazing job, I am back in school studying computer science, I moved back in with my mother despite the shame I felt, I have a wonderful relationship with all my friends and family who flocked to my side through it all, and I have found an amazing new partner with a young daughter of her own. Breaking contact with my ex was the best thing I could have done. There was no more arguing. No more trying to convince her to change. No more banging my head against a wall when she would knowingly throw all the common sense back in my face to justify her actions with feelings and lies. I had to change me. I had to change my life. And I did.

Once it is done, it's done. You will always feel pain at the loss of love. That's what love is. It's a connection that binds itself into your guts. When it's ripped out, you feel it and it stays with you. But if you choose to take that feeling and turn it into a drive for change, you will find a better place. Figure out what you can do and how you can affect change in your life, and you'll be fine. Much love to you all, I wish the best for each and every one of you.

There has been no physical abuse, but a ton of verbal abuse, and my mom doesn’t know what to do because he won’t leave. Both of their names are on the house, and bank accounts, and neither one wants to leave the house because they feel it is theirs.

,Divorce,"FYI - this is a throwaway account and I'm located in NJ.


Sorry for the formatting, typing from my mobile.  I tried searching on lawyer but it looks like it returned every post in the sub :-)


So I've finally reached my limit dealing with my alcoholic spouse (a visit by dyfs is my last straw). 


My problem is that I have no clue how to go about finding a good lawyer. The only time I've needed a lawyer in the past has been for our wills and the house purchase and the one that did our wills is retired and the attorney for the house was recommended by the real estate agent.


None of my friends have gotten divorced so I don't have any word of mouth to go on and Googling just seems to return a ton of results but I can't tell how to separate the ambulance chasers from the good ones.


Are there criteria that I should use to narrow down my search?  Like narrowing it down to those only in my county so they have better insight into the county judges?  Should I only look at those that specialize in divorce, custody (cause custody will be my #1 priority) or both?

,Divorce,"Hi all, 

My first ever post to reddit and it’s a throwaway.

I don’t have anyone in a similar position to talk to so hoping some internet strangers can help me!

I’ll give some background to the situation.

I’m (male) Getting a divorce after 8 years together and 6 months married. We don’t have any kids together. long story short - the relationship was bad. She constantly threatened to leave me because of my job amongst other things. I didn’t want to get married about a year before we did but got caught up in the “it’s too late to pull out” and “maybe marriage will save the relationship”. I didn’t handle the end of the relationship well at all. I met somebody else who made me happier and told her and left her. Can’t justify what I did but anyway. 

The house situation. 

We bought a house together about 3 years ago and I put all my savings into it. She put very little into it. I paid a large deposit and paid for the renovations to it with the view to selling it for a profit in a few years. Obviously I didn’t predict the end of the relationship would be 3 years away and the house was agreed to be split 50/50 when sold when we first bought it.

Anyway. She’s determined not to go through the solicitors and her request is for me to agree to pay her a fee to sign the house over to her in its entirety or she will drag the divorce out as long as possible and take me for every penny I have. Fortunately (or unfortunately) I don’t have a penny, I put it all into the house. I said the house should be sold and split fairly which would give me the majority of the money I put in back and she would make a tidy profit to move on. 

So the guilt thing. She’s constantly guilt tripping me saying it’s all she has is the house and I’d be destroying her life if she has to sell it and move (i was kicked out the house and the locks were changed the day I told her it was over and moved into my parents) 
 
I feel awful because it was me who ended it and now I’m asking her to buy me out or sell the house, which she refused to do either. I wish I could afford to give her the house but I’d be left with absolutely nothing and I just want to move on with my life with enough to start again. 

Sorry for the vent, I’ve probably missed loads out. 

Am I being totally unreasonable? 

My family and friends all say the house should just be sold but it’s the nagging guilt feeling that’s killing me.

She’s pressuring me now to agree to it this week and I just can’t. I have sought legal advice who have reassured me but i don’t know.

Anyway sorry for the wall of text, just really venting and looking for peoples opinions

,Divorce,"So I've seen many posts of people suffering horribly, hurting so bad they can't believe it's possible they can be better one day. This community helped me a lot, so I'd like to help by sharing how I felt, in hope that some of see that you are not alone.

First I had a feeling that I was hit by a train. A huge, debilitating shock, coming from nowhere. And as I understood, every other day, the extent of my loss, the implications, it was getting hit by a car, and another car, and another car. I told my psychiatrist that story, she told me that at some point you have to get out of the tracks.

Then I quickly had to understand that the love of my life, the one person I trusted so much I had children with was now a stranger and that their interests and mine were actually conflicting. I did not have to be fully convinced of that. It was enough that a small part of myself would adopt this perspective so that I could hire a counsel, discuss with my banker, setup a separate account, think about custody, the house, etc., While the rest of me was still in denial. At that time I did not communicate directly with my STBX in an effort to reduce the pain. So now part of me remains on denial but I'm in the house, I've got money secured and I see my kids 50/50. It's not final but if things go wrong i'm ready.

I also drew on all available means to try to get over it. My background: I'm a scientist, breed in the most traditional occidental 'you must control your passions/psychiatry is for morons' environment. I throwed all my prejudice away very early. My cocktail of solutions was sport, yoga, therapy, meds, friends, family, mandalas, journaling, redecorating, guitar playing, self development books (I recommend 'the untethered soul' by Michael Singer), etc. And it was barely enough. I remember that early on I installed dating applications because I was so worried i would remain alone my whole life. A few weeks later I removed them : priority was getting better, back to work, kids, getting used to being alone (hard one). Also, at some point, many of my family and friends who did not live that or something similar began to pressure me to get better. I'm now comfortable with the fact that it's because they have no clue what it is. It's ok to hurt and be confused for a looong time. Just don't be 100% confused.

About suicidal thoughts. I had those. It was horrible. At some point I was like a spectator to myself and my brain was actually working on solutions to put an end to all this suffering and I would think about my kids and it did not change anything. I told my psychiatrist that, she put me on meds (I'm summing things up here but the lesson maybe is, again, don't try to man up, use all available means.)

Progress was so slow at the beginning I once told my brother I had the feeling I was trying to fill a lake by tossing rocks inside. Each rock is a huge effort, and it disappears with a flock and the lake is unchanged. When I told him that I also told him I hoped that one day one rock would stay at the surface; I would finally see some visible progress. Now I'm three months in, I can say I reached that step.

About the affair (my STBX was in an emotional affair). It hurts horribly and is a huge blow to self confidence. I recommend this site (and especially this page) I discovered recently : 
https://www.survivinginfidelity.com/healing_library/confrontation/fog.asp
Lesson #1 whatever your X tells you and even if you had your wrongs in your couple the affair is NOT your fault, period. It took me a lot of time to understand that.

So now I'm not out of the woods yet. Far from it. But I'm back at work. I'm here for my boys. I find pleasure again in some activities. I'm not thinking about what happened all the time (but not never...) I'm not looking for perfection. I'm not actively looking for my next wife. I'm ok with making slow progress and even going backwards sometimes.

And I'd like to thank this community because you helped me a real lot. I hope this post helps someone a little bit. Even today it felt good writing it, just getting things on paper, sort of.

Hello! To keep it short, I (20f) am divorcing probably the loml (21m).
I’ve been going back and forth about turning to reddit out of fear of ridicule for our age, so if the only thing you have to contribute is “you’re so young, you’ll find someone else/it’s not the end of the world, you have plenty of time left” please, not so kindly, escort yourself away from this post. We’re young. We know. And it doesn’t make our relationship any less real for it.

On to the actual post.
We’ve been together since 11/12 and he’s been my best friend and here for me through a really rough second decade of life. The details of why we are getting a divorce don’t matter too much here, we just both have some growing as individuals to do before we’re ready to settle down and we’ve both done some pretty shitty things to each other that reinforces this notion (no infidelity and no abuse). 
I was the one to pull the trigger and he came around to it after months of miserable fighting, following a shit show year of being miserable for other reasons.
We live in a house over 2,000 miles away from our home state, we have 2 awesome dogs, 2 cars and have built the foundation for the life we always talked about having together as kids. We diy’d our divorce, everything has gone smoothly and we’re about halfway through the 90 day waiting period.
He moves back to our home state on Monday and I guess I’m just having a hard time letting go. I’m scared of the change. I know this needs to happen, but man is he leaving a huge hole when he goes. We’ve been spending a lot of tome together this week, just enjoying each others company and setting aside all the bad. The love is still there, it’s just not our time right now.
I’m fully prepared for him to start dating when he leaves, to see him move on and pursue his dreams and I’m excited for that. Im excited to see him happy and thriving. He’s really going to do great things with his life.
I’m excited to pursue my dreams and see what I can do with mine.
I guess this is just the “hold your breath before you jump” moment in time for me and our relationship . It’s the actual end in our eyes and I’m really not ok this week. I don’t know what to do besides ignore it all and put my energy into doing something better for myself, but I don’t think that’s a good coping mechanism here. How do you come home to an empty house after it’s all said and done? 
I don’t make friends very easily and the social outing thing isn’t really my scene, though I wish it was. I don’t have anyone to turn to, he was the only person left in my support system and now I’m just kind of alone.

,Divorce,"we were together for 9 years..married for 6 and have 2 kids. I blame the entirety of the bad parts of our relationship on myself. From the beggening when we were 18..i was a shitty boyfriend. I kept talking to other women...didnt treat her like I should have. If I could go back in time I would slap the shit out of my younger self. But..i did it over and over as the years passed and she caught it alot of the time. In turn..it made her do it to me..and I would catch it. Sometimes she would even claim shed do it and leave it for me to catch it purposely to hurt me. But..we always made it work. I was young and stupid..the most recent time was this time of year 2 years ago. She found out I was messaging ALOT of other women. I know I'll never be able to make up for hurting her so much..but I tried. It was just too late.  she told me she wasnt happy in january of this year after I caught her lying to me about going out one night instead of work and then she moved out in febuary to go live with her brother. Her entire thing  was was the she needed to leave so that she could make herself better mentally..so that we can come back together again..because it's her fault.



She has had mental issues her whole life...bi-polar...depression..but never was on her medicine the entire time we were together, she would get so temperamental and I'd walk on eggshells ALOT. Our sex life was also non-existent. After our second child it would hurt her to do anything..she recently found out she has cists on her ovaries and is scared. But she knows if it turned out to be something serious I would be there for her. 

She moved out in febuary and everyday started hanging out with the guy she is currently dating. I was really shitty everyday because I was pissed...I was mad because I felt like I was replaced immediately. So she did everything possible to hurt my feelings...throw him in my face with our kids and all..and it made her just hate her guts. So I divorced her and it just got even more nasty for a while.



So now she has been living with his family for the past few months..she is now currently living with his grandparents and he lives at home with his mom but they spend the night together constantly. 

I eventually got a girlfriend...she moved in with her daughter(yes I know..it was way too fast) and now I regret it. She is great and takes care of me...but regardless of everything..how shitty we were to each other..I cannot give her 100% because I still love my ex wife.

Fast forward to a month ago. My ex comes to my job to talk to me about our child's school and breaks down...saying she still loves me..she still wants us to be together...her end goal is still for us to be together no matter how long it takes. So I said okay..fuck it..let's work on us. We have talked alot...spent a little time together and talked and worked out some issues. She is now in therapy and on her meds and is working on getting her own place. She told me yesterday and the is just ""playing the part "" with her boyfriend. Bevause she is working on getting her own place...so that she can break up with him..so that we can be back together. Wether that takes 8 weeks or 8 months. She is going to keep ""playing the part"" because she knows who she wants to be with. They are even officially ""engaged"" but even after talking to her yesterday...she has this whole ""master plan"" of hers to break up with him and come back to me. But wants to wait till tax time so that she can have a place of her own to retreat back too In case we ever have bad days together but she also mentioned that maybe we could pool our money together and find a place together by then. She says that no matter what even if I tell her to fuck off whenever she tries to come back that she will fight and do whatever it takes to get me back. I want to believe this because I really want to give it another try.

I'm willing to drop everything now for us to try again. But she isnt. Shes not mentally ready she says...and needs more time to get her shit together and her own place together. I do agree that if she moved back in now..it would turn out toxic and bad...Idk what to do...I cant wait for her forever..but I want too at the same time...but it kills me and it hurts :(",t2_4pf5a81p,False,,0,False,Ex wife still wants us to be together...what do I do..,[],r/Divorce,False,1,,0,False,t3_dbub6k,False,dark,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Life After Divorce,False,0,,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1569969493.0,text,1,,text,self.Divorce,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;we were together for 9 years..married for 6 and have 2 kids.

I was young and stupid..the most recent time was this time of year 2 years ago. She found out I was messaging ALOT of other women. I know I&amp;#39;ll never be able to make up for hurting her so much..but I tried. It was just too late.  she told me she wasnt happy in january of this year after I caught her lying to me about going out one night instead of work and then she moved out in febuary to go live with her brother. Her entire thing  was was the she needed to leave so that she could make herself better mentally..so that we can come back together again..because it&amp;#39;s her fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has had mental issues her whole life...bi-polar...depression..but never was on her medicine the entire time we were together, she would get so temperamental and I&amp;#39;d walk on eggshells ALOT. Our sex life was also non-existent. After our second child it would hurt her to do anything..she recently found out she has cists on her ovaries and is scared. But she knows if it turned out to be something serious I would be there for her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She moved out in febuary and everyday started hanging out with the guy she is currently dating. I was really shitty everyday because I was pissed...I was mad because I felt like I was replaced immediately. So she did everything possible to hurt my feelings...throw him in my face with our kids and all..and it made her just hate her guts. So I divorced her and it just got even more nasty for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now she has been living with his family for the past few months..she is now currently living with his grandparents and he lives at home with his mom but they spend the night together constantly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually got a girlfriend...she moved in with her daughter(yes I know..it was way too fast) and now I regret it. She is great and takes care of me...but regardless of everything..how shitty we were to each other..I cannot give her 100% because I still love my ex wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a month ago. My ex comes to my job to talk to me about our child&amp;#39;s school and breaks down...saying she still loves me..she still wants us to be together...her end goal is still for us to be together no matter how long it takes. So I said okay..fuck it..let&amp;#39;s work on us. We have talked alot...spent a little time together and talked and worked out some issues. She is now in therapy and on her meds and is working on getting her own place. She told me yesterday and the is just &amp;quot;playing the part &amp;quot; with her boyfriend. Bevause she is working on getting her own place...so that she can break up with him..so that we can be back together. Wether that takes 8 weeks or 8 months. She is going to keep &amp;quot;playing the part&amp;quot; because she knows who she wants to be with. They are even officially &amp;quot;engaged&amp;quot; but even after talking to her yesterday...she has this whole &amp;quot;master plan&amp;quot; of hers to break up with him and come back to me. But wants to wait till tax time so that she can have a place of her own to retreat back too In case we ever have bad days together but she also mentioned that maybe we could pool our money together and find a place together by then. She says that no matter what even if I tell her to fuck off whenever she tries to come back that she will fight and do whatever it takes to get me back. I want to believe this because I really want to give it another try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m willing to drop everything now for us to try again. But she isnt. Shes not mentally ready she says...and needs more time to get her shit together and her own place together. I do agree that if she moved back in now..it would turn out toxic and bad...Idk what to do...I cant wait for her forever..but I want too at the same time...but it kills me and it hurts :(&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Tl;dr: no property, no kids, just cash. Wife worked, husband didn’t and wife feels guilty not giving him half.

I’m separated, 32/F from my foreign husband 34/M. We married after a few months of dating because I “knew” I wanted to marry him and wanted to make life easier for him by kicking off the complicated green card process. I was 27 when we married.

A few months after he received his working papers and temporary green card, he quit his job and told me he wanted to pursue his own business. I begged him to consider a slow ramp up to entrepreneurship but my parents were entrepreneurs and I ultimately decided to support him. I wasn’t given too much choice since he abruptly quit his job.

He made, on average, $20k a year for the next 4 years freelancing out of the house while I pursued a career and began bringing in over $200k a year. He would never tell me how his business was doing month over month and i would ultimately find out how much he made all year when filing our taxes. The business covered our 1bd in paper and boxes and seemed to be 24/7. Any time I came home or on the weekends, he was “working”, tweaking things on the computer for hours on end.

I finally had enough and took him to therapy and gave him an ultimatum. Get a job outside of the house or I am leaving you. Money wasn’t the issue really, we didn’t need more and I was happy working, it was about his effort in the marriage and how controlling/unkind he was. He was a recluse and refused to go out to celebrate things (like me landing an amazing new job), was controlling about money (made me feel bad every time I bought a coffee) and was just generally difficult to live with/didn’t show me love.

Fast forward, he didn’t follow through on the timeline we agreed and he lied about looking for jobs. I forced him to find a job and he moved to a different city that I was planning to transfer to later in the year. I am now also in this city but we are living apart with no contact as I recover from what I believe to be narcissistic abuse.

I drew up a separation agreement that does not equitably divide our assets. We do not own a home or have kids but have $ in the market and some savings. I told him I would give him a significant amount of cash, if he signed an agreement that he will not go after any other assets. We saved a lot of my money by never going out, feeling guilty for purchasing anything etc. I am angry and feel that I covered his cost of living, trips and that most of not all of the savings is from my effort. He didn’t look after me or kids or the home. He’s agreed to sign but I feel terrible, deep guilt for not equitably dividing our assets. Should I? Or should I give him half since he did live with me and was my partner (however imperfect) for 6 years?

,Divorce,"My STBXW introduced her boyfriend to our kids this weekend.  We decided to divorce last Sept and I moved out mid November of last year.  For me it's still fresh and new and I'm still processing the divorce and in a rebuilding/focus on me phase.  I've dated but am not ready for a relationship.  We have not filed and are still working on our overall separation agreement but IN REALITY we  are married only in the legal sense.  For her it's been over likely well before last Sept and it's not my place to question whether it's too soon for her to have a new relationship. She felt ready and she wants a new life partner, and clearly she has fallen in love.  Great for her.  I had made it clear I really didn't want to know what she was up to so receiving the news was shocking. Assumed she was dating.  Didn't think she'd get her this fast....but knew with certainty she'd be the one to introduce someone first.  It was painful to learn but that's for me to deal with and I'm dealign with it.

More to the point however is the reality that this new person will be spending time with my kids, and I'm just curious about how others have navigated this aspect of divorce.  Clearly at some point we will both have sig others that are part of our kid's lives.  And this would seem to necessitate a discussion btw the two exes as to what the rules, boundaries and expectations are.  These questions have nothing to do with any judgement about the person or the exes right to fuck, love and be with whomever they want.  It's not about that.  It's about where those choices intersect with the kid's lives.

How did you go about this?  I have questions about how often this person will be around during her days/nights.  Will she have him sleep over our her nights with the kids?  Will he be allowed to be alone with the kids (if she wants to work out or has errands or just needs a baby sitter)?  Will he go on vacations with them?  Will be there at the holidays she has the kids for?  More esoterically how does ensure that this person's values and beliefs align with the ones my ex and i have imposed?  Will this person be allowed to discipline the kids?

I am sure there are questions I'm missing.  And I now feel the need to begin a discussion with her on this subject--it has nothing to do with my wanting to know more about this person.  I don't really, and I 100% recognize I have no right to say or judge her love live or how she spends her time.  But I do have a right to understand and even shape how this impacts MY  KIDS.  I actually think she did this too soon....not in the sense of it being too soon for her to have fallen in love but too soon b/c the kids are still adjusting to this new life.  I don't know what questions they may have but I need to be there to answer them and so this necessitates my STBXW and I having a discussion about this.

That said there are only so many things one can control.  Really it will be up to her (and to me, when I have a sig other) to be the buffer and to be sure that this other person does not cross a line.  My kids have a father.  I'm all for there being a new man in their lives who loves them and can teach them things, but that needs to be done in a balanced way.  And I hope my STBXW realizes or is committed to the idea that our roles as cop parents and our children's well being takes priority over our won romantic needs and desires.

These questions have nothing to do with any judgement about the person or the exes right to fuck, love and be with whomever they want.  It&amp;#39;s not about that.  It&amp;#39;s about where those choices intersect with the kid&amp;#39;s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did you go about this?  I have questions about how often this person will be around during her days/nights.  Will she have him sleep over our her nights with the kids?  Will he be allowed to be alone with the kids (if she wants to work out or has errands or just needs a baby sitter)?  Will he go on vacations with them?  Will be there at the holidays she has the kids for?  More esoterically how does ensure that this person&amp;#39;s values and beliefs align with the ones my ex and i have imposed?  Will this person be allowed to discipline the kids?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure there are questions I&amp;#39;m missing.  And I now feel the need to begin a discussion with her on this subject--it has nothing to do with my wanting to know more about this person.  I don&amp;#39;t really, and I 100% recognize I have no right to say or judge her love live or how she spends her time.  But I do have a right to understand and even shape how this impacts MY  KIDS.  I actually think she did this too soon....not in the sense of it being too soon for her to have fallen in love but too soon b/c the kids are still adjusting to this new life.  I don&amp;#39;t know what questions they may have but I need to be there to answer them and so this necessitates my STBXW and I having a discussion about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said there are only so many things one can control.  Really it will be up to her (and to me, when I have a sig other) to be the buffer and to be sure that this other person does not cross a line.  My kids have a father.  I&amp;#39;m all for there being a new man in their lives who loves them and can teach them things, but that needs to be done in a balanced way.  And I hope my STBXW realizes or is committed to the idea that our roles as cop parents and our children&amp;#39;s well being takes priority over our won romantic needs and desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open to all advice and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"TL;DR Want to pursue romance but can't flirt due to years strictly avoiding it. Help?

Sounds typical, yeah? I suppose it is, but my reasons seem odd.

A few things about me first, I'm(M24) rather attractive, reasonably fit, confidant when I want to be, and make friends easily and have many fiercely loyal ones (both ways). When it comes to flirting, signaling romantic interest, etc. I've lost it.

Was married 5 years, before that I was an incessant flirt, ladies man I guess, usually by accident, I wasn't very persuant, just my personality.

But during the marraige I was just too damn good at being emotionally &amp; mentally faithful. I believed strongly in not flirting, and avoiding any sort of lust towards other women. 

Now that I'm alone, while I have full interest and attraction towards plenty of women, when it comes down to attempting to flirt or anything like that, I just can't. There's a wall there that I built myself. I can be friendly and all that, most people take a liking to me. But I remain strongly as just as friend, because I myself keep it that way, whether I want to or not.

,Divorce,"I told my husband a few months back that I wanted to separate. For background context we've been together for 11 years and married for 2 of them. We purchased a house last year and just had a baby. My entire pregnancy he was not there for me. He admitted to me that he realized that he didn't want to have kids just before we found out I was pregnant. When I told him about the pregnancy he said ""congratulations you got what you wanted"" and then proceeded to tell me that I needed to change my diet for the baby. He's convinced that I gave up on our marriage and on him. We were having communication issues before I got pregnant but his behaviour after is what pushed me over the edge towards separation. I had morning sickness throughout my pregnancy and he never felt the need to check up on me while I was at work. When he called during his work shift and I was home napping he would get angry if I didn't answer. Even after I would explain that I was exhausted and sleeping when he called.

---

Thinking about my dumb stupid dead (yay!) marriage again today. The divorce is going to be finalized this week. I get paid spousal support equivalent to how much it would have cost for me to go to therapy for many years while I was with him; it's the least he could do after inflicting even more fucking trauma on me. (He can afford his own therapy now that all he has to show for himself is his bank account.)

I went into an old email account I'd pretty much abandoned in 2014, after randomly recalling the name of the therapist I was seeing back then for work stress issues. She'd become our marriage counselor.

Wow, was this trip down memory lane an eye-opener...

Three years after we got married, the relationship was already 100% dead. It's obvious after reading everything over now. I stayed because I believed him saying if I left, it showed a lack of commitment. I also felt like I owed him support and energy because my goodness was he a *fucked up individual*.

He was already not committed to going to counseling, cancelling whenever he ""felt bad"" at random. Whenever he emailed her about incidents between us, he'd leave all the details out that would make him look bad; his dishonesty was flagrant. I was emailing the counselor with ALL of the details and he got angry at me for it. 

I was truly blind to that in the beginning, took another 2 years before I started noticing ""No, that isn't normal or respectful behavior."", because I thought he was just... not being precise.

I forgave him so much because I thought he was just shy or didn't know how to do things.

Most sessions focused solely on him, his own personal problems--that's why I'd dropped counseling together and told him ""Go to therapy for yourself"", which he never did until earlier this year, and then threw in my face.

**That man never loved me.** I feel the need to be compassionate with the poor, spineless idiot I was who was letting herself be ignored and used by that guy. I'm just so glad I stopped giving him sex. Now that I look back... that's all that guy ever wanted, was to be validated sexually and I was the stupid one who showed up and believed that he wanted more.

People are telling me he'd need self-awareness (which he never developed) and some willingness to look at himself (which he never had, he's too weak) to change and grow out of his self-centeredness... I'd forgotten just how *incredibly* selfish he used to be. He actually mellowed out over time but was still way too self-centered! And maybe I was already past my limit, probably true. But I mean, does that even matter? Do I even need to think about that, now? The guy was just looking for his very own personal hole to have and to hold. Heh.

After reading all that, though... jesus. Do I even have any hope of developing good judgement where men are concerned? I was willing to look the other way for so much. I supported and coaxed him to go to therapy nonstop for 6 years. Nothing happened. Maybe it took this much crap piling up over 10 years to finally be able to say ""I HAVE DEVELOPED SOME SELF-RESPECT BECAUSE I PUT MYSELF THROUGH INSANE FUCKING RELATIONSHIPS."" I'm ready for someone sane to walk through the door.

That guy, my ex-husband, is a manipulative, lazy PoS. I'm disappointed in myself for having given anyone even remotely like him a chance in the past. This is where I stop ""giving chances"" and this is where whoever makes a mistake in a relationship with me has to own up to me and fix the damage on the double--**because it matters**--because I am going to kick them out of my life otherwise. I've always done that for myself, and for whoever I was with. I should never have accepted otherwise from anyone else, but I used to... because I thought ""people are flawed, and so am I"".

,Divorce,"How do people get through this?  I’m struggling so hard.  I feel like I’m just waiting for this to be over, for him to finish doing whatever this is and come back and tell me he was wrong and he wants to make things work.  I know he won’t, and I know even if he did I shouldn’t, but I just miss him so much it physically hurts.



I just don’t understand it.  How after over two decades together he can feel ok or even good about being without me.  I can’t.  I feel wrong, every day.  I can’t imagine waking up to a different face, but he seems to have no issue with it.  He wants things to work with her.  We aren’t even divorced yet.


My heart hurts.  I feel like a part of me has been ripped away and I’m bleeding out.  Everything I had planned, the future I was working toward, the life that we built has been taken away.  My happy memories are tainted by learning that he’d been cheating for years.  My person, my constant, is gone.  He wants to change now.  He wants to stop lying and cheating.  He thinks he can wipe the slate clean and start fresh going forward.  And while I should want him to be a better person and find happiness, I’m also terrified that he will succeed.  He wouldn’t and couldn’t do that for me, but he will do it now and she gets the benefit?  If he was alone and fixed himself, I wouldn’t feel this way about the next woman he was with.  But not her.  She got him through mutual cheating.  She prevented him from making a true effort to fix our marriage.  She does not deserve the version of him that I should have had all these years.

I’m struggling so hard.  I feel like I’m just waiting for this to be over, for him to finish doing whatever this is and come back and tell me he was wrong and he wants to make things work.  I know he won’t, and I know even if he did I shouldn’t, but I just miss him so much it physically hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don’t understand it.  How after over two decades together he can feel ok or even good about being without me.  I can’t.  I feel wrong, every day.  I can’t imagine waking up to a different face, but he seems to have no issue with it.  He wants things to work with her.  We aren’t even divorced yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart hurts.  I feel like a part of me has been ripped away and I’m bleeding out.  Everything I had planned, the future I was working toward, the life that we built has been taken away.  My happy memories are tainted by learning that he’d been cheating for years.  My person, my constant, is gone.  He wants to change now.  He wants to stop lying and cheating.  He thinks he can wipe the slate clean and start fresh going forward.  And while I should want him to be a better person and find happiness, I’m also terrified that he will succeed.  He wouldn’t and couldn’t do that for me, but he will do it now and she gets the benefit?  If he was alone and fixed himself, I wouldn’t feel this way about the next woman he was with.  But not her.  She got him through mutual cheating.  She prevented him from making a true effort to fix our marriage.  She does not deserve the version of him that I should have had all these years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don’t know how to get better.  I still cry almost every day, and it’s been months.  I think about him constantly.  I miss him.  I want my life back.  I want things the way they are supposed to be.  And failing that, I want to find a way to let this go and find happiness again.  It’s just that I can’t see a happy future.  I don’t want any of this.

You both looked adorable, dressed to the nines and enjoying the end of what I assume to be an anniversary dinner.  Was it a 20 year, or perhaps a 10 year and you married later?  You appeared comfortable and familiar. It was a special night out.  

As you waited for the valet, I saw the warm glow of a shared bottle of wine on your face.  The flirtation and excitement of a special night out.  I saw the absolute admiration in your husband’s eyes as he stood before you, holding you by your shoulders at arms length so he could gaze at your body and how beautiful you looked.  It was a moment of such raw desire and admiration, and I was lucky enough to see it and share it with you.  

I felt so happy for you. Happy that you shared that kind of love and desire for each other, even after many years. 

After savoring the moment, tears immediately rolled down my face.  My joy for you quickly turned to heartache (or jealousy?). I craved that sort of attention from my husband.  No amount of talking, counseling, or begging would make him look at me the way your husband looked at you. All I wanted was to feel desired,  To not be turned away when I tried to make love.

,Divorce," 

So I am coming to realize that the household I grew up in wasn't conventional by what is defined as being a healthy household. I am not sure if this is the right place that I should post this but I've been reading some stories and wanted to try to get my thoughts down on ""paper"".

Moral of the story is recently I have become pretty independent of my parents. Ever since they got a divorce I didn't want to be involved with my dad in any way. I haven't spoken to him in over a year now but he claims to have no idea why. Naturally this is a distressing matter so I have turned to the internet to find information ranging from why he behaved the way he did as well as myself. What I found made me want to talk about it. If your still here at this point, I'd appreciate it if you'd here me out.

There are a lot of things that I don't remember from when I was younger, but I do remember every time my dad got angry. The first really bad episode was when I was about 11. We were coming back from a party and I thought that we all had a good time. When we got back to the house tho my dad exploded on my mom, something about she didn't hold his hand during something and that she spent too much time with her friends. This was particularly vivid to me as the fighting and yelling was happening in my room. My mom begged him to settle down so my brothers and I could go to sleep first then they could talk about it but he wasn't having it. He just wanted to yell, I don't even know if my mom apologizing meant anything to him. After that night I began notice everything else.

The next few years were really bad, there was at least an episode just like the one previously described at least once a month. He wouldn't just yell at my mom, he would yell at my brothers and I as well. It always seemed to about little things like not mowing the lawn correctly or not volunteering to change the car oil or stupid stuff like that. The point is that even as a kid the reaction never seemed to be justified by what he was complaining about. My mom would always apologize to us that he is only like this because of his work. You see, my dad was in the military and had a very successful career at that. He had been on numerous tours and deployments and left the military at a very high rank (I'm intentionally keeping the details vague). My mom went to a doctor who said he probably had PTSD so she would often blame his behavior on that. It made sense and helped her take the blunt of his anger but it just kept coming.

At some point I joined football and played in high school. Coincidentally around that time my dad was starting to calm down. That or my parents were getting better at hiding it. My mom did try and get marriage counseling but even after the counselor told my dad that he was 95% of the issue here all he focused on was the one thing the guy said about my mom's behavior towards my dad THAT SHE ONLY DID SOMETIMES. Anyway, football did to me what football does to most people and I became exponentially bigger, stronger, and faster than my dad. Around the same time my older brother went to college so I helped my mom take care of my younger brother who was now in middle school.

The episodes started becoming an every now and then thing. Instead of every month they were happening every few months. There was one were I had to leave the school dance because my little brother texted me and said it was a really bad fight. I drove home to find my mom trying to redirect my dads anger from my little brother who had a bad soccer game and he wasn't happy about it. Because that's what your son needs when he has a bad day right? To be yelled at about his bad day?! Since I was bigger now I would sit in on these fights and make sure they didn't get out of hand. More often than not I would just yell ""Calm The F\*\*K Down, we are trying to Sleep!"" and that would make dad unhappy at me to which it would often become a pissing contest between us. I didn't mind it so much tho. I had been watching my dad be angry all the time at my mom and it would infuriate me. Especially when I couldn't do anything about it. Now that I knew I could at least stand a chance physically I was more than willing to take the blunt of his anger. That night ended with him leaving the house and coming back later in the morning. Every time he had an episode he'd never talk about it and this time was no different; he'd simply act like it never happened and then start ordering my little brother and I to do chores or something stupid. I always would hate this and wanted to scream ""REALLY, THATS ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY!"" but since I am basically my mothers child I'd be careful about what I say as to not upset him and would seldom complain.

I'm going to tell you about one more episode and this is the one that I constantly think about. It's rather short but is probably the most impactful. One night I was already asleep when I woke to two very angry voices yelling at each other. Naturally I knew this was my parents so I stayed up to listen. It kept escalating tho. Something worth noting is that at this stage in my life my mom was starting to yell back and call him out on his BS anger stuff, this of course only made him angrier. Anyway, there came a point in that night that made my stomach drop, I heard some thuds and a slap. I started running towards the door when I heard my mom yelling my name in a panic. My blood was pumping full of adrenaline and I felt it too. It was some kind of survival instinct came over me but it was telling me to fight. I slammed open the door and in the same motion hit my dad and tackled him to the floor all the while screaming ""Get AWAY from Her!"". My mom then grabbed my little brother and I and said we are staying at the neighbors tonight. They were more than happy to let us sleep there. My dad didn't try to stop us but he was yelling at my mom. It turns out that my dad shoved my mom and blocked the door to their bedroom as she tried to leave the area since she didn't want to be yelled at anymore. She then slapped him across the face and when he grabbed her she started screaming my name. The thing that infuriates me as well is he tried pretending the next day that I shouldn't be involved in this. That it wasn't my place to stop them from ""sorting it out"". I'm pretty sure that this is BS but I had to go to school. They stayed together and then a week later it was like it never happened. That I didn't have to get my dad off of my mom and that he doesn't have anger management issues or anything. Because we were just dumb kids right? Why would we care about what goes on between our parents.

The worst part is that despite everything I mentioned it took another 2 years before my mom decided to get a divorce. She told me the reason she got a divorce was because ""I wasn't there to take his anger anymore"". That doesn't sit well with me even to this day. Would she have stayed with him if I was still there to be his punching bag? I feel like she should have left him years ago and not waited for me to help her out. I know it is selfish but what if I never grew bigger to start taking it over and she never gained the confidence to start fighting back? It just seemed unorthodox to use your son as shield to hide behind but don't get me wrong, I was more than glad to do it because I wanted something to change and she deserved much better. My brothers and I are mostly raised by our mom and she is incredible. My older brother was very good in school and is pretty successful in the work force. I am currently in college but have had numerous internships by now so I'd say I turned out OK. The reason I'm writing this is because I still can't escape my dad. He had the audacity of not even understanding why my mom filed for divorce when I left the house. I mean, even your own friends thought it was obvious! It just amazes me, he keeps playing this wounded animal thing and tries to guilt my brothers and I into talking to him. He constantly brings up how he is the reason we are alive and he paid for our food and mom was the reason for those fights too and blah blah blah blah. There were other factors that happened during the divorce process that made me stop talking to him but I wont get into those. I just don't quite know how I feel tho. I guess its mostly anger but anytime someone yells or I get a text from him or something I turn into this self imploding ball of sadness and adrenaline and I don't know what to do. I take great pride in getting myself in a situation where I don't need money from him, my mom, or anyone. I am employed and going to school and 100% independent from my family. My older brother and I are even planning to pay for a rather nice trip to universal for my little brother to have a vacation. But it just constantly feels that no matter how far I travel or how much I pre-occupy myself that I cannot escape it. When I talk to people its like I'm walking on eggshells. I also do this thing where I try and fix other peoples lives whether its with school, finding a job, or there having emotional problems I always try to be there. It helps me take my mind off of my life and enjoy someone else's for a little bit. I don't know where I'm going with this really. I just wanted to gather my thoughts and maybe tell someone about it.

If you made it this far you're an awesome person. I'm not here to claim that I had the worst life on earth cause at this point its just a matter of perspective. I've never told anyone about this in such detail but I'm still living in some kind of fear and wanted to talk about it. Hopefully this can help some other people in similar situations by knowing they are not alone.

My mom went to a doctor who said he probably had PTSD so she would often blame his behavior on that. It made sense and helped her take the blunt of his anger but it just kept coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point I joined football and played in high school. Coincidentally around that time my dad was starting to calm down. That or my parents were getting better at hiding it. My mom did try and get marriage counseling but even after the counselor told my dad that he was 95% of the issue here all he focused on was the one thing the guy said about my mom&amp;#39;s behavior towards my dad THAT SHE ONLY DID SOMETIMES. Anyway, football did to me what football does to most people and I became exponentially bigger, stronger, and faster than my dad. Around the same time my older brother went to college so I helped my mom take care of my younger brother who was now in middle school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The episodes started becoming an every now and then thing. Instead of every month they were happening every few months. There was one were I had to leave the school dance because my little brother texted me and said it was a really bad fight. I drove home to find my mom trying to redirect my dads anger from my little brother who had a bad soccer game and he wasn&amp;#39;t happy about it. Because that&amp;#39;s what your son needs when he has a bad day right? To be yelled at about his bad day?! Since I was bigger now I would sit in on these fights and make sure they didn&amp;#39;t get out of hand. More often than not I would just yell &amp;quot;Calm The F**K Down, we are trying to Sleep!&amp;quot; and that would make dad unhappy at me to which it would often become a pissing contest between us. I didn&amp;#39;t mind it so much tho. I had been watching my dad be angry all the time at my mom and it would infuriate me. Especially when I couldn&amp;#39;t do anything about it. Now that I knew I could at least stand a chance physically I was more than willing to take the blunt of his anger. That night ended with him leaving the house and coming back later in the morning. Every time he had an episode he&amp;#39;d never talk about it and this time was no different; he&amp;#39;d simply act like it never happened and then start ordering my little brother and I to do chores or something stupid. I always would hate this and wanted to scream &amp;quot;REALLY, THATS ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY!&amp;quot; but since I am basically my mothers child I&amp;#39;d be careful about what I say as to not upset him and would seldom complain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to tell you about one more episode and this is the one that I constantly think about. It&amp;#39;s rather short but is probably the most impactful. One night I was already asleep when I woke to two very angry voices yelling at each other. Naturally I knew this was my parents so I stayed up to listen. It kept escalating tho. Something worth noting is that at this stage in my life my mom was starting to yell back and call him out on his BS anger stuff, this of course only made him angrier. Anyway, there came a point in that night that made my stomach drop, I heard some thuds and a slap. I started running towards the door when I heard my mom yelling my name in a panic. My blood was pumping full of adrenaline and I felt it too. It was some kind of survival instinct came over me but it was telling me to fight. I slammed open the door and in the same motion hit my dad and tackled him to the floor all the while screaming &amp;quot;Get AWAY from Her!&amp;quot;. My mom then grabbed my little brother and I and said we are staying at the neighbors tonight. They were more than happy to let us sleep there. My dad didn&amp;#39;t try to stop us but he was yelling at my mom. It turns out that my dad shoved my mom and blocked the door to their bedroom as she tried to leave the area since she didn&amp;#39;t want to be yelled at anymore. She then slapped him across the face and when he grabbed her she started screaming my name. The thing that infuriates me as well is he tried pretending the next day that I shouldn&amp;#39;t be involved in this. That it wasn&amp;#39;t my place to stop them from &amp;quot;sorting it out&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that this is BS but I had to go to school. They stayed together and then a week later it was like it never happened. That I didn&amp;#39;t have to get my dad off of my mom and that he doesn&amp;#39;t have anger management issues or anything. Because we were just dumb kids right? Why would we care about what goes on between our parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part is that despite everything I mentioned it took another 2 years before my mom decided to get a divorce. She told me the reason she got a divorce was because &amp;quot;I wasn&amp;#39;t there to take his anger anymore&amp;quot;. That doesn&amp;#39;t sit well with me even to this day. Would she have stayed with him if I was still there to be his punching bag? I feel like she should have left him years ago and not waited for me to help her out. I know it is selfish but what if I never grew bigger to start taking it over and she never gained the confidence to start fighting back? It just seemed unorthodox to use your son as shield to hide behind but don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I was more than glad to do it because I wanted something to change and she deserved much better. My brothers and I are mostly raised by our mom and she is incredible. My older brother was very good in school and is pretty successful in the work force. I am currently in college but have had numerous internships by now so I&amp;#39;d say I turned out OK. The reason I&amp;#39;m writing this is because I still can&amp;#39;t escape my dad. He had the audacity of not even understanding why my mom filed for divorce when I left the house. I mean, even your own friends thought it was obvious! It just amazes me, he keeps playing this wounded animal thing and tries to guilt my brothers and I into talking to him. He constantly brings up how he is the reason we are alive and he paid for our food and mom was the reason for those fights too and blah blah blah blah. There were other factors that happened during the divorce process that made me stop talking to him but I wont get into those. I just don&amp;#39;t quite know how I feel tho. I guess its mostly anger but anytime someone yells or I get a text from him or something I turn into this self imploding ball of sadness and adrenaline and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I take great pride in getting myself in a situation where I don&amp;#39;t need money from him, my mom, or anyone. I am employed and going to school and 100% independent from my family. My older brother and I are even planning to pay for a rather nice trip to universal for my little brother to have a vacation. But it just constantly feels that no matter how far I travel or how much I pre-occupy myself that I cannot escape it. When I talk to people its like I&amp;#39;m walking on eggshells. I also do this thing where I try and fix other peoples lives whether its with school, finding a job, or there having emotional problems I always try to be there. It helps me take my mind off of my life and enjoy someone else&amp;#39;s for a little bit. I don&amp;#39;t know where I&amp;#39;m going with this really. I just wanted to gather my thoughts and maybe tell someone about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far you&amp;#39;re an awesome person. I&amp;#39;m not here to claim that I had the worst life on earth cause at this point its just a matter of perspective. I&amp;#39;ve never told anyone about this in such detail but I&amp;#39;m still living in some kind of fear and wanted to talk about it. Hopefully this can help some other people in similar situations by knowing they are not alone. Anyway have an awesome day and keep on keepin on!&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"My soon to be ex (30f) and I (34) are going through a divorce. We have three beautiful kids together and 8 years in this. But she gave up  within a month and moved on. 

Backstory:

We met and married quickly. She was broken and I wanted to fix her. Her mother kicked her out at 22. She told me one thing but the actual reasoning was different.

Throughout the relationship, we had our problems. My career was up and down and she never worked. She also always had another guy on her mind. I would have to hear about this guy a lot. We fought about how much I had to hear about him. She would even Facebook stalk him and sometimes randomly text him (she doesn't know that I know). This continued off and on until 2yrs ago when she gave him a bj one night out drinking with a friend. 

On top of all this, we had three kids. It was rough. She still didn't have a job and it put a ton of pressure on me. Also, she suffered from depression throughout our marriage too. She would just spend the money as fast as I would make it and would get mad at me when we were tight on money. 

She accuses me of being verbally abusive. Not like calling her name's or fat or anything, but when we would fight, I would cut her character down. Why? Because I felt like no one was helping me in this partnership. I had to do everything.

Her depression was bad. She would mostly stay home and never wanted to go anywhere. All I wanted from her was to keep the house clean and in order. But that barely happened. I never had clean clothes or hardly a home cooked meal. I didn't ask her to do much. Just help me why I worked 10+ hrs a day.

So before she decided to ask me for a divorce, she drained my savings account. Would spend it on all kinds of things. Even paid her college debt down (10k). She ended up taking 20k and leaving me with only like 10k. That was just last month.

She kept giving me false hope of us getting back together while having a Tinder Profile and talking to several guys. She even promised me to quit but didn't. So finally, she decided with the month she didn't want to be with me and we just finalized our divorce papers

,Divorce,"This is long...

I (33/F) just went to pick up my son from his father. I’ve only been moved out for a month.  His dad, 31/M, had a giant hickey on his neck. I am devastated. We were married for 8 months. I was hoping to give him space so he had time to think and ultimately decide to reconcile. It’s obvious now that he wanted me out so bad so that he could entertain a girl. He has a 7 yo from a previous relationship (my stepdaughter) and we have a 1.5 yo son together. 
 
Background:
In February, he went from really lazy to going to the gym and now has lost 70 pounds. Also in February, he scared me to death by not coming home until 4 AM (when he had to be up for work at 6:30 AM). He didn’t understand why I was panicked and checking police Facebook pages for accidents. He said he was hanging out with people from work and forgot his phone in his car. He later admitted he lied about who he was with. He said he was actually with two girls from work, which could also be a lie for all I know. On Valentines Day, he told me I’m the love of his life. 

In March, he repeatedly changed his phone password. He said that he changes it because the girls at work like to go on his phone and take selfies. That seemed far-fetched to me, but I didn’t think he had a reason to lie. Even after I asked to go on his phone to change a Spotify song, he changed the passcode. He also started deleting his text messages, which he had never done before. I know this because he asked for an address that was texted to him that he no longer had because he deleted everything. Also, a lot of couples I know use location-sharing. After the panic i had about him being missing all night, I innocently suggested using some sort of location-sharing ourselves so that situation doesn’t happen again and I know he’s not in a ditch somewhere. He flipped out on me, saying that I just want to know where he is all the time because i don’t trust him. I assured him that I do trust him and I wouldn’t have married him if i didn’t, I was just very scared that night when he wasn’t answering his phone. He completely blew the whole thing out of proportion, which again was strange. 

He first mentioned the D word in March. 

In April, we had some arguments. Mostly to do with my insecurities. But his actions were making me insecure and started to make me think I was crazy. Whenever I was behind him, he always turned the chair so I couldn’t see his phone. Yes, he’s constantly on his phone. He turned off the screen notifications so I couldn’t see if someone texted him if he left his phone lying around. I asked him why he always turns his phone away from me and turned it around on me, saying I’m insecure and paranoid. Was I???? He also admitted that he feels like he HAS to lie to me so I don’t get mad. And he thinks I don’t like his daughter (I LOVE her and have been in most of her life so I don’t know where this is coming from).

In May, on Mother’s Day, he said he didn’t know what he’d do without me. Later that month I said I would go see a doctor about the way I’m feeling. Something just doesn’t feel right. Is it me? Post-partum depression? Is my gut trying to tell me something?

Rewind real quick. Last year, February 2018, I had a traumatic birth that ended with an emergency C section. (Sidenote: he slept during the hardest parts of my labor when I needed him most.) Then two weeks after coming back from a six week maternity leave in April, I was laid off from the job I love and had for many years (lost clients, had to lay people off). So I spent the next ten months caring for the baby pretty much by myself (he didn’t get up during the night even though we formula fed), applying to jobs, having many phone interviews, working part-time from home at night to pay bills and planned a wedding. I took my three month old dress shopping alone with me. I had no help, no local family. 

In October, we got married. Life was great for two months. 

In December, I was hired for a job that had me commuting two hours a day. It was incredibly hard on me to leave the baby at daycare after being with him for ten months. There were times that he’d already be asleep by the time I got home. 

Back to May this year, I agreed to see a doctor to see if my Wellbutrin needed to be upped (I have been on it for anxiety for years). I couldn’t tell if it was me or my husband’s weird behavior that was making me so crazy. The doctor said that she thinks I’m just exhausted. (She didn’t believe medications were always the answer.) I started researching therapists to see on my lunch breaks, hoping to find new coping mechanisms. 

In June, I decided that we wouldn’t have any arguments. I thought June was going great. We went out on little adventures and I had a great time with my husband and children. On June 24th, we were talking in bed and he admitted more lies to me, which hurt but they weren’t anything serious. Then he said he didn’t want this anymore and wants a divorce.  He wouldn’t tell me why, just that his feelings changed and he didn’t want to tell me more because he didn’t want to hurt my feelings. To this day, I still don’t know what that means. 

Cue two months of crying and complete misery on my end. He wouldn’t come home until late, moved to the couch. We talked to lawyers. Shit was real. I still had hope he would realize divorcing wasn’t the right thing to do. I moved out in August because he couldn’t take me being in the house anymore. 

I’ll admit I wasn’t the happiest, but I had been through a lot in a short amount of time (or so I feel). 2018 was just a crazy year. Being away from the baby was hard, adjusting to the new job was stressful. The commute was horrible. But I thought I had support, when the truth was, I didn’t. He never comforted me when I was crying. He never had words of encouragement. He really wasn’t supportive at all in retrospect. He didn’t want me to quit my job and go back to part time while looking for something closer because he would “resent me”. I guess I was used to how he is after being together for 3+ years. 

After seeing the hickey tonight (yes I was hysterical and made a huge scene, ugh... also, you’re welcome for the show, neighbors), it really feels like something has been going on for a lot longer than what he’s telling me. None of his behavior this whole year seems normal to me. He disconnected from this relationship far sooner than I thought. He says that he wasn’t talking to the hickey girl when we were together, but he’s lied so much that I can’t believe anything he says. Even after we were “separated” at the house, he continued to lie to me. I don’t even know why. 

I don’t feel comfortable having a girl I don’t know around our 1.5yo son when he’s with his dad. He says our son isn’t around her, but I saw him yesterday when he picked our son up and he didn’t have a hickey. Today when I went to pick our son up, my husband had a hickey. So it had to have happened last night even though husband said he went to someone’s house and made out. (I’m sure they had sex but he kept saying kissing because the kids were around... Where was our son if he went over to someone’s house?)

I’m having a hard time figuring out if I’m crazy. Was all of his odd behavior just coincidental? I have been blaming myself for three months. If only I were happier, if I were more positive, etc., I wouldn’t have pushed him away. Or was he really talking to someone else? Even if he was talking to another girl about our relationship problems, he should’ve been talking to ME, his actual wife, so we can figure out how to fix things. I’d like to note also that he admitted he cheated (he said kissing) and started an emotional affair while he was with his ex-fiancée so it wouldn’t be out of character for him to do this to me (boy did I ignore that red flag). 

Now he is 31, divorced with two children from two different women, going to work tomorrow with a giant hickey on his neck. He should be proud of himself.

I still want my family back. 

TL;DR: Together almost 4 years. Married 8 months. Husband started behaving odd/off character earlier this year. He kept telling me that I’m jealous and insecure, but his actions were making me crazy. I still don’t know the truth, and I still don’t know if I’m crazy. He moved on REAL quick. Everyone says he doesn’t deserve me. I can’t believe this is happening to me. What the actual fuck.

,Divorce,"My STBX starts the talk of divorce, she pushes me to the edge, and then she decides the wants to back off leaving me as the bad guy who has ""already decided it's over, and won't do anything to fix our marriage."" Then if I start trying to make things better she goes right back to the divorce talk again. 

I figured out why.

She wants to be guilt-free in this separation, or at least share the guilt with me. 

Sure she's scared, we're both scared. It's terrifying. I hate having to be the one who has to push her to do what she really wants to do, despite the fact that none of this was my idea in the first place. 

She's back in one of her ""we can fix it"" phases and I have to be a jerk and remind her that she's just saying what she did the last two times we tried to fix it. She's made no changes in her life, so it's going to follow the same pattern again. She'll be right back to her old miserable self within a couple of weeks.

Everyone of us has a narrative in our head. Looking through this group I'd say we skew 90/10 on ""the divorce is the other person's fault"" vs. ""the divorce is my fault."" Everyone wants to think they're the hero.

&lt;p&gt;I figured out why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wants to be guilt-free in this separation, or at least share the guilt with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure she&amp;#39;s scared, we&amp;#39;re both scared. It&amp;#39;s terrifying. I hate having to be the one who has to push her to do what she really wants to do, despite the fact that none of this was my idea in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s back in one of her &amp;quot;we can fix it&amp;quot; phases and I have to be a jerk and remind her that she&amp;#39;s just saying what she did the last two times we tried to fix it. She&amp;#39;s made no changes in her life, so it&amp;#39;s going to follow the same pattern again. She&amp;#39;ll be right back to her old miserable self within a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone of us has a narrative in our head. Looking through this group I&amp;#39;d say we skew 90/10 on &amp;quot;the divorce is the other person&amp;#39;s fault&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;the divorce is my fault.&amp;quot; Everyone wants to think they&amp;#39;re the hero. &lt;/p&gt;

When we got to the hotel, it was creepy. It was smelly and dirty and the people were shady. So I hardly slept and spent more money I don't really have to get a different hotel for tonight.

,Divorce,"# Relapse is apart of Recovery...Right?

So today is my Day 1...again.  It should be day 3.  But I relapsed.  Yeah.  

I really wanted to begin this whole 30 Day, ""no-crutches"", ""on my own"", ""feel the pain- don't numb it"", thing...during the process of the beginning stages of my divorce.  When we first separated, I was naive...I was only seeing the silver-lining of being alone.  My freedom.  Freedom to leave the house with breakfast dishes on the counter and not feel guilty.  Freedom to come and go as I please, to go out...meet new friends, meet new guys... This stage was supposed to be about finding myself, exploring what I really want, Becoming an independent person so that I could be a WHOLE person, not a half of a couple...  But you can't just jump into becoming a whole independent person when you had been dependent for literally your whole life.  (First on my parents, then on him...)  

That would be like trying to grow out your bangs overnight.  It takes time, you  need to adjust to how you look, you go through that awkward phase of ugly hair...then one day your hair just falls perfectly into place, seemingly overnight, but definitely not.   So I feel like I've just chopped off my hair into rugged bangs.  I need to figure out how to style my hair, adjust to my lack of confidence of not having that security blanket over my face...and certainly they won't grow overnight.  It's been 3 months since I've been ""out on my own"".  Of course I was going to try to fill that void my STBX left...and I was glad to do so. 

And I wish someone would tell me ""It's okay-  you're hurting, you're allowed to use crutches- it's only been 3 months...""  But in reality I now know that counting on anything else not substantial or positive to fill that void is just hurting me further, keeping me in the same routine that I was with my husband, the same routine that drove me to hate my life.    

So yeah- Relapse.   I had gone almost 3 whole days without contacting my number one crutch.  But yeah...relapse.  I answered a message.  Giving him the satisfaction that I still care.  And me not getting ANYTHING in return.  Not a ""how are you holding up, I miss you""  Nothing.  Ouch.  

And I drank with friends, which was on my okay list-  because as long as I wasn't drinking alone, or when I was sad- it would be okay.  I wouldn't do anything stupid.  But still.  I should have stayed home last night.  I should have wallowed in my misery, sober and alone.  I should have felt it down to my core and cried myself to sleep.  That's what I SHOULD have done.  I would have felt like I got over a milestone of being alone.  But I didn't.  I wasn't alone last night.  I drank,  I gave a piece of my heart away, again...and I felt like garbage all day today.  Maybe if I suffered last night, I would feel better today.  That's the whole point of this 30 day no-crutches thing right?  Suffer first, peace later?  

Or am I rushing the process.  Am I justified in wanting a relationship from someone who would only give me 20%- just so I could feel okay in those small moments?   Am I crazy to want to be able to drink and cry by myself?  Instead of trying to function normally already?  Is it that wrong to find comfort in the opposite sex to validate that I am still wanted, still attractive, still someone's future, someday...

All those things would make me feel better right now.  But I'd feel like garbage tomorrow.  So I guess there's my answer.  Here's to Relapse and Recovery...of a broken heart....Day 1.

,Divorce,"So I told my STBXH back in July that I wanted to pay off our debt and divorce.  
He apparently didn't believe me, and has been going about the last 3 months like we're all good. Meanwhile, I've been aggressively paying off our debt, researching how it goes, etc.

Well, today I had it. He said a bunch of stuff about 'our' future together. I took him aside and said ""You realize I was 100% serious about divorcing right?""  
You'd thing hell fucking spat me out right there as his personal demon to torture him.

A few things I was told

\- I want him to 'be my whore' because I would like sex more than 3x a year.  
\- I'm using him to pay off our family debt and then I'm going to discard him (okay this one was kind of true)  
\- The last 13 years apparently don't mean anything to me  
\- He obviously can't trust or rely on me because I'm breaking the marriage vows I said when I was 19 and pregnant and homeless.  
\- I'm 'just like my mom' (we don't talk, that's a huge insult to me)  
\- Buying my own place is a pipe dream anyway, and I should make 'good financial decisions' instead  
\- Am i cheating on him!?!?!? (no.)  
\- It's my fault we're in so much debt because I was begging him to quit his job and then didn't communicate with him that he needed to go back to work (wrong, he wanted out just as much as I wanted him out)  
\- He's upset I talk to my friends about him and I need to stop 'whining, moaning, and complaining'  
\- He complained he was afraid he'd take our kids away from him, but then two breaths later said if he didn't have us he'd go nomad and go to the oil wells or whatever to make some money (????)  
\- I'm not giving him enough time to get shit together (I plan on leaving in summer, once the kids are done with 2019 school year)

He wants to be 'equal' in regards to my business (which is upside down financially - we owe more than we're worth, and also he wouldn't even know where to start in regards to running it) and our house, and even though I offered to let him have literally everything but my business - as in, walking out, not even taking pots and pans with me - he wants to evaluate the value of everything and contest me in regards to the business I built by myself from the ground up.

And he was totally off guard. I honestly said in July ""I want to pay off the debt and divorce"". Those exact, clear, non ambiguous words. I'm really upset that it's all my fault. He didn't even try to save us - just immediately started in on this crap. :/

,Divorce,"Believe it or not, poker night is no different. Some arrive with friends, some arrive alone. Someone engaged on the phone with a family member. Most are here to win, a few expecting to straight up lose, and the rest just wanting to see what happens. Where they all agree is on having a good time.

A proper deck shuffled uniformly will yield more possible arrangements than atoms on Earth. And that's just counting the cards. Within those astronomically unique, discrete arrangements lies the core of the experience; the heart of the game that all players seek to conquer. And despite knowing what's to come - hard fought wins, harder losses, and boring or awkward games in between - all players try to achieve the same thing. That nail-biting, entrancing, mind-racing, edge-of-the-seat blowout that steals your breath and takes the entire table by surprise. And you can only hope it will be yours.

People handle loss differently. Everyone expects it to some degree, but their coping mechanisms run the gamut. On the sadness end of the spectrum, disgust-filled cynicism and ""that's my lot"" kinds of philosophy. On the happiness end, confident shrugs and ""let's see the next hand"" forward thinkers. Some withhold from engaging in the excitement until an oversized bet hits the table. You have your barrel-right-through headstrong bullriders, and you got your sulk-and-linger headshaking plodders that carry on.

Everyone plays what they're dealt, and your finite opportunities are made all the more precious by the night's inevitable end. The decision to fail fast by folding early becomes all the more agonizing when considering the possible, albeit remote success you might still achieve by hanging in there.

You can do the math all day and still lose the hardest. You can walk in late with barely an awareness of the rules and win big. Backwards as it may seem to our meritocratic way of thinking and contrary to how anyone will behave, passion does not drive the results. Dedication alone will not dictate the outcome. Outside the tiny realm of possibility within our direct control, luck and circumstance reign free of the shackles of ruth. That's not just poker, that is life.

Which brings it all back to the question of why you are here. Not as an existential question, but your coherent decision to come and be dealt some cards to play. You knew what could happen. You knew the possibilities. You knew losing is an integral part of the game. Yet you came here, hoping to win, expecting some fun, ready to shoot the breeze with other people. Does that mean you expected guaranteed happiness?

Were your expectations of fulfillment inexorably tied to a boldly winning outcome, and therefore randomness?

Hopefully what you expected was an interesting evening packed with learning experiences. Hopefully what you got were some new friends: maybe older, maybe younger, or perhaps even roughly the same age. Hopefully you were better off here than spending the entire evening alone, truly by yourself. I hope the pain you feel now pales when placed against the vacuous loneliness you would have felt in staying home.

But above all, I hope you found at least some of the good times you came for, and not necessarily in the last hand. I hope that on the whole, even if you lost everything in the end, the chances to win and the opportunity to bond were worthwhile. And if not, maybe next time.

,Divorce,"So we have been together for 3 years now. I've been set employed with intermittent jobs dispersed between, but making more overall by myself. She's been working a grand total of maybe 8 months. She never did anything hard or uncomfortable if it wasn't absolutely required to stay alive. I mean that realistically. Like she would go two sometimes 3 days without eating just because she didn't want to wash a pot for ramen noodles, and was perfectly content to wait until I made food which didn't happen often as I'd normally just eat out while at work. She was happy to play video games all day every day, pushing away any and all types of responsibility. I would literally go to work for 10+ hours per day, come home and clean up after her, make food for her, and generally cater to her every need. Last July, after pestering her for over a year to get a job and her *actively* looking for a job with no success, I broke up with her since we were still dating. Many years were shed, and she begged for days to stay. We were only apart a month, but in that month she got a job, got her own place, started going out with friends camping, started going to the gym, showering every day... Basically being an adult. Made a complete 180. When I found out, I asked her if she would take me back, and we got back together. I moved in with her on the condition that I'd pay half the bills. Two months later, things were still going great, and life was amazing. I was happy, she was happy, I didn't have to worry about money for once in my life because we had a combined income. One day she asked me if we were still engaged. I guess so? Well then she asked when we were getting married, and I stupidly said anytime we wanted to. Fast forward 4 days and it was done. Not two weeks later she started going downhill. She did a complete 180 again, and I was 100 percent supporting her. A few days ago, I told her I was tired of taking care of her, and it was her turn to scratch my back.

A little back story of her drama - she says things she doesn't mean to get what she wants. ""I'll call CPS on you!"" ""I'm gonna sue you!"" ""I can ruin your life!"" 
I've lost all but one of my friends, and my entire family (cousins aunts, uncles, everyone) hates her because of this. On top of that, she's thrown ""bring divorce papers tomorrow!"" And ""don't come home tonight!"" In my face several times just to manipulate me into coming home from going to the theater by myself or something fun I wanted to do.

Anyway, after I told her to take up responsibilities, I went to my brother's to help with some work, and she texted me not 2 minutes after I left. ""Just stay at his house tonight. I can't do this anymore. Bring divorce papers tomorrow. No 50/50, just keep what's yours, and I'll keep what's mine.""
I know it was intended as a manipulation tactic, but I'm so fed up with her, I said fine. She immediately went into ""you don't love me?"" And ""I didn't mean it!"".

I had to go back a couple days later because she was going to torch my stuff including my work phone owned by my employer. I had a cop escort me while I gathered my stuff. Now she is doing everything she can to hinder the process. Threatening alimony if I don't come back, suing me for mental/emotional abuse, all that she can think up.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after I told her to take up responsibilities, I went to my brother&amp;#39;s to help with some work, and she texted me not 2 minutes after I left. &amp;quot;Just stay at his house tonight. I can&amp;#39;t do this anymore. Bring divorce papers tomorrow. No 50/50, just keep what&amp;#39;s yours, and I&amp;#39;ll keep what&amp;#39;s mine.&amp;quot;
I know it was intended as a manipulation tactic, but I&amp;#39;m so fed up with her, I said fine. She immediately went into &amp;quot;you don&amp;#39;t love me?&amp;quot; And &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t mean it!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to go back a couple days later because she was going to torch my stuff including my work phone owned by my employer. I had a cop escort me while I gathered my stuff. Now she is doing everything she can to hinder the process. Threatening alimony if I don&amp;#39;t come back, suing me for mental/emotional abuse, all that she can think up. I&amp;#39;m all right with being separated for a while before filing for divorce so she can straighten up. Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"If you're reading this, chances are you're consumed with a lot of emotions right now.  You're not sure which end is up, why this is happening, or when it will end.  We're sorry that you're going through this, but we're glad that you are here.  /r/divorce is dedicated to helping those suffering through divorce with general advice, internet hugs, and just the solace and comfort that comes from talking to people who have walked the road that you're on.

We encourage you to talk about your situation.  The first step to healing is getting it all out in the open.  **A word of caution**:  If you feel your situation may be a difficult legal battle, or you are worried that it might become one, avoid sharing very specific details that may allow someone else reading your posts to figure out who you are.  There have been divorce cases where social media posts were brought into the courtroom.  

Here are some general guidelines to help you:

Please Do:

* Tell us how old you are, how long you were married, how many kids, if you own a house, etc.

* Tell us if you're using a mediator, collaborative divorce process, attorneys, or trying to DIY/Pro Se.  Please note, most people in this sub (and pretty much all the mods) are going to urge you not to go Pro Se, especially if children are involved.

* The basic reasons for the divorce.  Infidelity, physical/sexual/emotional abuse, addiction, irreconcilable differences, etc.  This is where details are important, but careful consideration of how much you reveal can be important.  ""Infidelity with a co-worker"" is fine.  ""STBX is traveling to Vegas and hooking up with co-workers at the ABC Pharmaceutical Sales Convention this weekend"" is not a good idea.

* Tell us where you are emotionally, as best you can.  This is an important step in the healing process.

* Tell us what you'd like us to do to help.  We can't offer specific legal advice, although we can let you know what to expect from the legal system, and we do have a handful of attorneys who are kind enough to offer their opinions from time to time.  But this sub is no substitute for a competent family law attorney.

* Rant or vent if you need to get it out of your system.  We've all been there before, we know it hurts.

* Realize that the family court system is not meant to be a place to seek justice, revenge, or moral victory for you.  Family courts exist to legally dissolve a marriage in the most efficient and fair manner possible, and to look out for the best interests of the children.  Your hurts, anger, bitterness, sense of betrayal, whatever, have no place in the courts and are irrelevant to the consideration of your child's best interests.

* Remember that you can no longer dictate/control/demand any sort of behavior out of your STBX.  They are free to spend their/your money in any manner they see fit; live with, sleep with, date with, cavort with, hold hands with, write the great American novel with whomever they see fit.  They can make whatever parenting decision they choose on their time.  We have a saying in /r/divorce: There is no law against being a bad parent.  There is also no law against being a bad ex-spouse.

Please **Don't**:

* Bash your STBX.  It is okay to be angry and hurt.  You should be.  But calling them names, tearing them down, and generally dragging them through the mud does not help you in any meaningful way.  We want you to tell the truth (""STBX has a drinking problem."") without badmouthing (""that [censored] waste of a [censored] who do they think they are [censored] drinking all day and spending all of our [censored] money).  We're not going to ban you, remove your posts, or chastise you for violating this suggestion.  But we may remind you that it isn't helping you with your recovery.

* Assume that custody will go for/against you because of your gender.  ""The courts are biased against fathers"" is pretty much a myth in the US today.  The courts are definitely biased against fathers who try to go to court without a lawyer.  Especially if the mother has an attorney.  Overall, however, most courts in most states are very open to 50/50 physical and legal custody if the circumstances allow it.  If you insist on posting a ""I know I won't get/will get custody because *my* state is gender biased"" thread, be prepared to have this notion challenged.  

* Take legal advice from your STBX or their attorney.  Once an attorney is involved, *they represent you or your STBX.  Not both of you.*  Do not fall into the trap of letting your STBX convince you to ""let my attorney handle it for both of us.""

* Make it a gender thing.  Men cheat.  Women cheat.  Both sexes choose to cheat at roughly the same rate, depending on what studies you want to point to.  Making generalized ""why do all men cheat?"" or ""why can't women be trusted?"" statements are not well received and will usually result in the post being removed.  Your STBX may have cheated, but one person does not a data point make.^TM 

* Use this sub as a place to further your own agenda.  If you have a burning desire to publish your misogyny or misandry manifestos, there are plenty of repositories of hate elsewhere on the internet.  This sub is not one of them.  We have one mod in particular who will relish in mocking your posts as he removes them.  Consider yourselves duly warned.

* Attack others.  We have a very diverse viewpoint in this sub.  We have Christians, Atheists, Agnostics, hippies, yuppies, hipsters, old farts, gentle curmudgeons, sarcastic barwenches, webcam girls, attorneys, gypsys, accountants, soldiers, sailors, airmen, police officers, peaceful resistors, lost souls...get the picture yet?  We're all different, but for one reason or another, we all belong to the fellowship of suffering that is divorce.  For that reason alone, we all respect one another's advice, opinions, and perspectives.  You do not have to agree with someone, but you do have to respect them.  All of the mods are very quick to support this.  This sub exists to aid in the healing of all members of this fellowship.  Not just the ones that adhere to your particular view of it.

We're sorry you're here.  But we hope we can help during the time you choose to remain part of our fellowship.

It was always an easy marriage we hardly ever had arguments.   she is a Very kind and Compassionate person. once kids came it made it harder to focus on the marriage and just devote all time to the kids.   about 3 years ago she said let's go to counseling.  we did and it helped for a bit. both work demanding jobs.. we kind of trailed off from counseling as work and kids took all the time.  she asked me a few months ago to go back to counseling.  i knew things had gotten off again between us since the last year or so i happily went.  unfortunately this time it to let me know  our marriage was over and that we had grown apart and the emotion connection between us is gone.   She loves me but we both need something out of each other we can't give one another.

Like most husbands.  i spend the first week trying to figure out how i could fix it.  but i also remembered the old saying by  the time a man figures out there is a problem in his marriage and tries to fix it. it's already to late.  the wife spent the previous year trying to fix it and i didn't see it.  :(

i realize that once one of the partners in the marriage is done you can't try to fix it. and it usually would make things worse to try.  so i accepted the marriage was over.  we are working now on how to be the best co-parents. and she is so nice to me it breaks my heart but i realize this is what must happen.

it's heartbreaking.  she and the kids leave in a few weeks.  they are only going about 15min away and we are looking at 50/50 co parenting with as much together time between all 4 of us as needed.   that's just it.  we are great roomates . we get along fine.  just different levels of emotion connection between us .

,Divorce,"Sometimes a guy has to hit his head against a door a few dozen times before he finally sees the light (and stars) but, after a back and forth texting tantrum yesterday where I vomited emotions at my STBXW, triggered by a relatively minor revelation, I finally realized that I have free will, and that I can make choices about this divorce.  Here are my epiphanies:

\-She will never give me the satisfaction I've been seeking.  It has to come from within.  She cannot and will not and has no desire to engage with me emotionally.  
\-There is no way for the two people in the marriage to say goodbye to it together.  There is no shared post mortem.  Each grieves separately and differently and for different durations.  
\-If it weren't for the kids we'd have no contact at all, or I would have been making contact with my vomited emotions, but she'd have had not reason to listen and would have blocked me.  Simply bc we have kids and thus communication channels does not give me to right to dump on her-My STBXW's coldness and stunning clarity all the way through about the fact that she was done and this was not a test was helpful. It was brutal and hard, but ultimately better than wishy washy false hope  
\-This was once the person I was closest to in the world. We brought two humans into the world and raised a dog, and professed our life long love to one other. And none of that means a goddamned thing now. We owe each other nothing more than coparenting now.  
\-I have the power to choose how I feel.  For 13 months, even as I've been working on me, I've kind of wallowed in sadness and tethered my feelings to things I felt I needed from here.  These were never going to come.  
\-The only way to get any closure is by surrendering to the reality--the divorce is happening, even if I didn't want it to--and to accept.  Surrender is simply making peace.  It is not a form of weakness.  It's giving up on the PAST in order to not waste the present.  It is letting go in a healthy way  
\-She has a boyfriend. I'd guess they fuck often in the bedroom that she and I shared for 12 years, and where we raised our kids and where my beloved dog slept. They take romantic trips and he now helps her around her house doing the things I used to do. She sucks his cock.  She likely loves him, and I'm sure he's a decent guy and he may love her.  He eats her out and gives her orgasms that likely inspire to profess to his prowess. They deserve to be happy.  And so I do, and I will find a great person, when the time is right.  Her relationship will not be perfect because they never are. It may last for the next 40 years or it may end in 6 months (and that won't matter). Accepting it and dealing with it as reality is better than sticking my hand in the sand and romanticizing him as the second coming and this is the single greatest romance of all time. It's two flawed humans, just as my marriage was, and just as my next relationship will be--only hopefully I'll take the lessons I'm learning now into that relationship, and be more aware of the flaws  
\-My kids will be fine and I cannot control some aspects of this because that is the nature of divorce (3 weeks ago my STBXW introduced her BF to them kids and it made me wonder about how people work this out; the reality is this is not something one can control; you cannot legislate your exes love affairs and relationships.

,Divorce,"When I married my wife 18 years ago, we had such a beautiful marriage. I really felt I was in a fairy tale. Within the first eight years of our marriage, we had two beautiful little princesses, how proud of a dad I am of my two girls, and what a great mother and role model she was. The future seemed bright and promising.

Fast forward 8 years, MIL is in the last stages of cancer and was invited into our home to live her final days. The death of my MIL was very traumatizing for my wife, no matter what counseling, psychologist, meds we tried, mentally, the damage was done. The only relief she found was in alcohol and as the weeks progressed after her mother’s death, she developed into an alcoholic. 

For the last 10 years, I have fought for my wife’s sobriety every day. I was always there to pick her up, clean her up, make sure she was ok trying to be the best husband I could along with playing both roles as a parent for my two girls. I stuck by her side amongst this including a few suicide attempts by her and the on going mental torture to myself and my children. Ive had to bear witness this beautiful person deteriorate into a high functioning alcoholic. This person was supposed to be my rock, my partner, a role model to my girls and chooses to drink her “medicine” and become angry at the world instead. 

I filed two months ago and since then, she has left. Our girls aren’t little anymore and they won’t stay silent. She had a choice to stay if she quit alcohol (me paying for full rehab) but her choice was to walk away from us and everything. 

Regardless of all this, it’s amazing to me how I still miss her, how I still love her, how I still worry about her wellbeing and how broken hearted I am to have allowed her to go. Now I know this had to happen, but now amongst the feelings of loneliness, failure, and regret, I’m also filled with the guilt of being responsible for any abuse my kids went through, how could I have kept this going for so long, I can tell you a man who loves his family will try and do everything he can for the best of everyone, unfortunately, we lost the battle to alcohol and one of our team members is now gone. 

I can share the worst part for me is how ones body reacts to traumatic events like this. Even though my brain says “you’re ok, work on yourself, focus on the girls, one day at a time” my body reacts physically with deep and shallow non stop heartbeats, similar to after a big meal, eye twitching, lack of hunger, amongst other items. My last meal was on Saturday where i nibbled a bit on chicken, that’s it. 

I look forward to the day where I can look back on all of this, but I sure wish there was a fast forward button.  We’ve talked a few times since she’s left.

,Divorce,"Greetings, everyone!  Here's my story.

35 year old male here and been married for 13 years.  One daughter who is nine and a son who is five - they are AWESOME.  I am a very involved dad.  I cook, make lunches, go fishing, sporting events, show up at all practices and games, volunteer to be mystery reader at school, etc.  Huge part of my life.  Own a house and recently made a career change in the last three years (huge personal leap).  I have a very active lifestyle.  More fulfilled and making a lot more money.

We have slowly grown apart over the last several years.  Even after we first got married.   I was very insecure in my mid 20s and had a career crisis.  She very much wanted kids and a house.  I wasn't really ready, but went along and didn't back down from being a dad.  But I made her pregnancy very unenjoyable and it was totally my fault.  I caused lots of damage here.  Started therapy and she showed little interest in going.

From there, we never really had date nights (two date nights since my daughter was born nine years ago), vacations, and very little emotional or physical intimacy.  I am fundamentally a very affectionate man.  My wife was upset with my unhappiness and attitude, but bore it in order to keep things stable and intact.  We had my son and moved into a house about five years ago.  Things continued to decline.   We have slept in separate rooms since (or each of us with one child) and the disconnect continues.  I tried really hard to get her to love me (lots of tears and quasi begging), but to no avail.  I made plenty of mistakes on the way.  Eventually asked for an open arrangement so I could date on the side if she wasn't going to try to work on things.  She said it was fine as long as she didn't know about it.   We haven't had sex for almost two years.

I found a great therapist and got a new job (she thought it was too big a risk, did not support it).   In the last two years, I've allowed myself to just be okay with grieving and being sad and lonely.  I used to beat myself up for being sad.  I also stopped trying to work on things.  Emotionally burned out and exhausted by trying. She continued to coast.

I have always been on the cliff of divorce, but finally took the jump a few months ago.  Started planning and thinking more intently about the process.  One part of the push over the edge was caused by meeting someone who simply just made me realize I can do better for myself.   I can stop living in this unhappy, dysfunctional marriage and happiness might be actually possible.

Breaking this to my wife obviously has been generally crazy.  She thinks I'm destroying her life and the kid's life.  Very traditional mindset.  Recently, she's been trying to be super wife and do all the right things.  But she only really wants to stay married to preserve what she sees is best for the kids.  To her benefit, she's started therapy (I'm still going on my own, she wants me to go to couples therapy but I have no interest) and is getting on anxiety medication.  In fits of rage, she's also accused me of being an alcoholic and asked one night if I would ever hurt her or the kids (which is INSANE).  The latest development is that she's turned my sister against me.

I just want a new life.  A fresh start.  My own place.  Have my children see their father happy.  I will live in a cardboard box for the first year if I have to.  I can't do this every day indefinitely.  She's going to fight it.  I have talked to several lawyers.  I am just thinking of the right time to file.

Emotionally, I am managing.  I started to develop a more supportive network (hopefully some support here too) at the end of the summer because I knew I would need it.  I figured she might turn some people against me.

I feel I've had some pretty good legal advice so far, but I would appreciate any other feedback.  She can refinance and keep the house.  I just want my own place around the block, enough money to survive at first, and be able to see my kids as much as possible.  She can have physical custody.

Thank you in advance!  All the best to everyone going through a similar mess.

,Divorce,"Like most stories, mine is a long one. I don't know where to begin. But this post in particular is about feelings of anger and frustration about my husband's behavior that I still deal with. 

I don't mean about the causes of the separation. I know I will be angry about that for a long time. 

I mean about the way he continues to communicate with me. We have a one year old daughter and a dog. I asked him if he will give the dog his medicine. No response.

I ask when he will come over to pick up our daughter. I have to ask multiple times over the course of days to get a response. 

Any time I ask something that he doesn't want to answer or doesn't think is important, he simply doesn't respond. Whether it's in person or by text.

The other day, she was crying and I smiled at her and he says, ""no, don't smile at her"". Not worth fighting over but I am so fucking tired of this man trying to control me. 

I hate how angry this makes me. I know I can't change him. We have been to 3 different marriage counselors. Two have refused to see him again. One said he gave up. 

How can I let this go? How can I be free of this frustration? I wish I could stop caring. He's still living inside my head.

,Divorce,"So, a little backstory first. My wife and I have struggled off and on for the past 6 years of marriage. We have consistently done our best to make it work, but we often end up repeating the same arguments and getting in fights about the same things. We both need help with anger, patience, and communication to name a few things. It's gotten so bad before that we have brought up divorce, but have never proceeded, especially now that we have two young kiddos.

One of the biggest things that has caused tension between us (but certainly not the root cause of our problems to be clear) has been her family, especially her mom (MIL). Her mom is divorced and remarried, and if I could describe her in one word it would be alpha-female. She thinks she can control everything and is very pushy, tense, and controlling. What has bothered me the most is something that I noticed starting four years ago, when our son was born. She pushed me to the side while my wife was laboring and had to be the one to comfort her. She gave my son his first bath along with my wife because she apparently had experience. She told me how to arrange my home and fought me on it the whole way. 

Every major life event- birthdays, Christmas, car buying, my wife and I fighting, other holidays, she has to be in control. She tells everyone what we're going to do, when, where, who's riding with who, everything. It was just my son's birthday, where my son hurt his hand on a new toy, and as I was comforting him, she comes up to him, tells him that he needs to stop crying and tell her what happened so she could help. Fed up, I grabbed my son, said ""thank you, name, I've got this"" and walked away. She seems to think she is his parent and constantly undermines me and takes advantage of not having to discipline him. 

My wife simply says that she is like this to everyone and that I'm jealous, an not to take offense. And any time I've brought it up before I'm either being an ass, being ungrateful for her help, or whatever. 

I'm truly at the end of the line here. I feel like we're going in circles and my wife cares more about her mom than she does me. I feel as if she will defend her mom against me any day and that we just aren't a team. I've decided to give my wife an ultimatum.

I'd like for her and the kids to stay here, put the past behind us and seek counseling, giving everything we have at keeping our marriage. However, I'd like for her to stay away and avoid contact from her family for four months, namely her mom, but the sister and step dad have done their share of being asses to me and toxic to be around. (This is now five months since she hasn't given me an answer, I admit that was out of emotion because I can't believe she's actually unsure of what to do)

The second option is to leave and go live with her mom in the second half of their house. We will divorce. It's a nice home with plenty of room, and if she loves her mom more than me, it shouldn't be a problem, right?

Of course she thinks I'm crazy, controlling, and she swears that she loves me more. But I told her she clearly doesn't if four months away from family is worse than a lifetime divorced from me.

,Divorce,"...nonetheless frustrating and my reality.  My wife and I, both 34, have been married for about six months now.  No kids and neither of us had previously been married.  I really want the marriage to work, but we're seemingly at each other's throats a lot more frequently than we're on the same page.  We have very little in common which is okay, but when you're not head over heels about the other person (which neither of us are), it makes it very difficult to spend quality time together.  Everything kind of went south about a month after I proposed to her.  It was by no means a surprise proposal (she was very insistent upon getting engaged), but didn't disclose to me the fact that she was 15k in credit card debt until after the fact.  Fortunately, I do pretty well and was thus able to pay off her bills, but I've found it hard to trust her ever since then.  I don't know if divorce should be contemplated so early in the marriage, but I think we're both happier when we're not around one another, so the end seems inevitable -- it's just a matter of one of us getting the ball rolling.

It was by no means a surprise proposal (she was very insistent upon getting engaged), but didn&amp;#39;t disclose to me the fact that she was 15k in credit card debt until after the fact.  Fortunately, I do pretty well and was thus able to pay off her bills, but I&amp;#39;ve found it hard to trust her ever since then.  I don&amp;#39;t know if divorce should be contemplated so early in the marriage, but I think we&amp;#39;re both happier when we&amp;#39;re not around one another, so the end seems inevitable -- it&amp;#39;s just a matter of one of us getting the ball rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus I&amp;#39;m nervous as hell to start acquiring community property, notably buying a house, since I would be paying 99% of it.&lt;/p&gt;

,Divorce,"Okay, a little background. Me and my Ex had been together for 7-8 years on and off a couple times. This man has always been a drunk and it has broken us up. I’m not sure if he’d technically be a narcissist, but I know I’ve been emotionally abused for SURE. I’m a shell of who I used to be. We’ve always had a toxic relationship, and he was always accusing me of cheating. 


We have a 3 year old daughter.
His drinking has always been bad but my younger self didn’t see the red flags until it was way too late. It got to the point where once, for example, I was on my way to pick him up and he still drove home drunk and passed out immediately after. This was a usual thing. 
So 6 months ago I found out he cheated on me and I moved out because he didn’t want to get counseling or cut back on his drinking. Ok fine. We’ve had almost 50/50 with our daughter even though she feels more at home with me, I feel bullied by my ex to always give him extra time with her. New girl who he cheated on me w lives at his house and his lived there since pretty much right after we broke up. My daughter is the one that told me this and I could tell she was uncomfortable because it was only a few weeks after we had split up. She was confused and acting out. (Obviously) 


Since we’ve broken up, somehow I’ve become the bad guy, and he’s been nothing but rude to me. Has done things like, when he knows I’m on my way to drop my daughter off, he leaves the house and I’m late for work. 
He’ll call me when she’s not behaving and blame me and have me come pick her up. 

Anyways... I had a consult with a lawyer today for full legal and physical custody (I have always dealt w school, bills, medical insurance). My idea was him having visitation every other weekend. 
My argument is that my ex drives drunk/passes out often from drinking, has an unstable living situation (5 people in a one bedroom), and his verbal abuse to me and my daughter. I have multiple screenshots of my ex saying “sorry I was drunk” or bullying me and spiraling into a drunken whatever you’d call it. 
The lawyer told me that the fact that i waited so long to file ( a couple months), will make the courts question is my complaints are valid. And that since my ex hasn’t had any recent trouble w the law (DUI) it will be hard to prove he is unstable. She completely shot down most things I said, Including how he bullies and verbally abuses me. I told her how he doesn’t want to pay for medical or school, and she disregarded that. She also stated that as long as my daughter has her own bed, the court will see that as acceptable. Even though there are constantly people drinking and smoking weed around her, and barely even has a “room”. More like a closed off section of the house. 


She told me they won’t do a house check either so whatever my ex says in his interview pretty much is.
also told me the court doesn’t care who cheated, who moved out, and all that. Which I totally get. But I guess where I’m going w this is, if they are looking out for the best interest of the child, wouldn’t they consider everything? I kinda feel like this particular lawyer wanted an easy case instead of this one, since apparently I have no real evidence. 


And for the record, I waited this long because I didn’t want to be a bitter asshole mom and i wanted my daughter to see her dad. I also always feel guilty, I think that’s his manipulation creeping in the back of my head always, but yeah.

,Divorce,"My mom announced to me this weekend that her and my dad could be getting a divorce. I moved out about a year ago and live with my bf and am only now at a point in my life where my parents and I have a friendship type of relationship where they are open with me and look to me for advice and friendship and not just as a child. 

This news has completely broken me. Growing up my family was the idealistic family where the two parents love each other and have a big home where everyone is welcome and my friends with divorced parents would often tell me they wish their parents were like mine. 

My mom came to me crying this weekend telling me they’ve been arguing non stop, and that she’s willing to do anything to change and reconcile their marriage. She found out he’s been talking to a woman at work who is also married and texting her and sneaking around to see her and telling her he loves her. My dad is an alcoholic and always has been and he is completely closed off in communicating, simply drinking and being the fun guy and letting things go without ever bringing up issues. He’s brought up issues from 20 years ago and on saying he’s never been happy and that she is too controlling and never lets loose or has fun (which is kind of true). 


My dad feels as though she’s manipulated him into being with her all these years. Partially this is because I am the oldest child and my brother and sister are still young 10 and 13 respectively. He is an amazing dad always worked 6 days a week to pay off the house early, cooked, cleaned, at every sports game, life of the party, funny outgoing, supportive etc.. From his perspective he has never been happy/ felt loved but coming from an abusive home growing up felt like he needed to be married to ensure he was in his kids life, he didn’t want weekend visitation etc (I was born the day they were married and a year and a half into their relationship) and dealt with years of arguing and controlling behavior and bottling up issues and resentment now feeling that’s there’s no way to restore it and find love when there was never a spark. He claims the lady is just a friend and is willing to go to counseling but only because he is scared getting a divorce will keep him from being in his kids life. 

He told me every year older they get there’s less reasons to stay and as he’s getting older and looking back on his life he sees that there was never a spark and that he probably has less good years left to enjoy without my mom then the length of time he’s been with her. 

It breaks my heart to see both of them so hurt. My mom wants to fight for the relationship and is changing her ways, cooking, cleaning, trying to be more affectionate etc. My dad genuinely feels there’s no connection and her changing is more of her manipulative ways trying to trick him into being happy with her. He also feels he is stuck and will have to spend the rest of his “good years” trapped in a loveless relationship for the sake of his kids that he loves more than anything. 

It honestly just makes me feel so disappointed and sad and hurt. I don’t even know what these feelings are but it hurts when you have this dream of what a perfect love is between two people you thought were happy only to find out they’ve been sacrificing their happiness to show you something that was fake. 

Any advice or kind words from anyone who has gone through this before would be helpful.

,Divorce,"I never wanted this. (24F) I blame myself for a lot of it. I didn’t date him (22M) long enough to see his true self, I was completely blindsided by what was about to take place. I had no business getting married, but I loved him. 

He showered me with gifts, compliments, and dinners. Not that the lavish things were important, but in the beginning you could see how I thought this was the start of my fairytale. This perfect guy comes out of nowhere and is so attentive. 

We got married in a rush due to Military obligations, but we had talked about it before that even came up so we both decided we would. 

Once we got married, suddenly he didn’t want to go into the Military anymore and bounced around from a few different places and a few different jobs. He knew my family had money, and kept suggesting that I see if they’ll help us out. I can’t believe I didn’t see that as a red flag. 

Flash forward only a month, and he became controlling, manipulative, checked my phone constantly but never let me have his, told me I couldn’t wear certain things (a bikini on the beach, etc), told me I wasn’t allowed to go certain places without him, and started fights over fictional things he made up that he convinced himself to be true. I had gone against my family with this union, so the last thing I wanted to do was admit that I made a mistake. 

I kept going with that draining lifestyle he bestowed upon me for a few months, but then one day had just had enough. I left him for a few weeks to figure out what I wanted. During that time he was ruthless with the calls and texts, but I ignored. Eventually I convinced myself to go back and give this another try because after all we were married and I wanted to say I did everything I could. 

The only thing I can say next is that I was convinced he was the Devil. Sparing some details, we got into numerous malicious verbal fights but I never thought he would get physical. One night he did, and I immediately left and never went back. One instance of violence is one too many. I feel so disappointed that I let this man into my life and into my family’s life. If I stayed married to this man I just knew I’d end up dead. But yet somehow I still feel GUILTY for filing tomorrow.. It’s crazy how after everything a psychopath can make you feel pity for them. 

His last “gift” to me will be putting off signing the papers. I’m asking the lawyer tomorrow what can be done if he refuses to sign. I guess I just needed to rant and thank you to whoever might’ve read all of this. I’m finally able to open up about it and I just ask for any advice that could possibly help me get over this trauma, although I hope not many of you have ever experienced this.",t2_19tz1ir7,False,,0,False,Meeting with the lawyer tomorrow.,[],r/Divorce,False,1,,0,True,t3_dlud4o,False,light,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Vent/Rant/FML,False,1,,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1571835301.0,text,1,,text,self.Divorce,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never wanted this.

,Divorce,"Hi, I filed for divorce about 2 months ago after 4 years of enduring a loveless marriage. We have a toddler together and I endured all because of my kid and the secretly hoped that he would love me again. Well, a day before I filed, my estranged husband,  just out of the blues- made it clear that he did not want to have anything to do with me and there was nothing I  could do about it. This was the final straw for me. I was heartbroken and evastated but I had to be strong  esp since he didnt care that I did.  I made the decision to leave the marriage before informing any family or friend. I didnt want anyone talking me back in. Anyway, fast forward. I find myself in extremely high spirits lately. I feel GREAT.  I am happier and I honestly feel so liberated.  Is this normal? Shouldn't I be scared of the uncertainty the future holds? What if I dont find love early enough to have more children.

,Divorce,"My kid turned 3 this weekend and my ex wife planned a day for family time with him. The problem is, family time only included her family, her live-in boyfriend, and me. 

I kept my emotions in check the whole day. I was really proud of that. But as the day went on, I kept seeing more and more that kept getting to me. I was able to shake it off in the moment, but once I was alone in my hotel room, it all came out. And since then my depression has been getting the better of me.  

I'm not in love with her anymore, but I see how she is with her new man. She was never that way with me. They were so affectionate with each other in public. For 12 years the most I could get was holding hands. 

It just drove home the fact that she never really loved or cared about me. Or that there is something wrong with me.  

I'm trying to shake this all off because it doesn't really matter. Son is back with me for the next couple of weeks, and he needs me to power through.

I just don't think I can get though another event like that. I don't even know why I agreed to it in the first place.
