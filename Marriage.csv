,Marriage,"Growing up sex was not talked about. No sex education,  No mother-daughter talk. In fact, nothing female was explained including my period, until after I had started.So of course I thought God was punishing me for masterbating and hid my underwear.

Then growing up there was genital shaming and jokes about oysters and fish. 

The vibe I got from the women in my family was that sex was a duty much like a chore. Didn't want to but had to as part of the marriage package.

I guess between the above and Church indoctrination I should have been what was called a ""dead fuck"" then. But somehow I came away with a sex in marriage is good view and figured it out on my own.

So appologies for the scheduled sex fiasco post. It seems that people are scheduling sex due to life stresses, kids, and work. I too felt myself at one time falling into a set schedule.

And this is what I should have said, but didn't and I'm really sorry about that. You see I was never allowed to express my views growing up. Just had to fall in line. So I'm rather ungracful and blunt because I've had such little practice.

My marriage went to another level of intimacy when I opened up more sexually to my husband and he to me. In fact, I can fuck at the drop of a hat but it took me years to make love. And once I incorporated making love the sex become more open and raw. I hid me behind fucking and fucking was my barrier to intimacy.

But, when sex went from just fucking for need and lust to an expression of love manifested, it somehow changed my view of the importance of sexual activity, all of it not just intercourse. It was like communion. Our private time in which we shared our soul and body. 

It was this realization that led to a more unstructured routine which caused me to grow closer to my husband. If the basis for marriage is love, then why not be open to more sexual activity I thought. For me, it turned out that the more sexual intimacy we had the more I desired it. Our sexlife deepened when we chose to offer up our bodies to one another without a set pattern or day.

The above is not to be confused with sex on demand. It's not. 

Sex was fun, it was healing, it was nourishing. No longer did I leap to the bathroom to drop his semen. It was part of the communion between man and wife.

,Marriage,"Hello,

I'm going to make this as quick as possible and would really appreciate the advice of married folks on here.

I've been with my wife for 6 years and married for 3. We had instant chemistry and I could see her becoming my wife. She has great values and is an all around great person which is why I married her. A year before we got married, I got a condition that completely destroyed our sex life for many months. She didn't leave and supported me until things got better which I appreciated. Neither of us has family in the US so we are 100% alone.

Eventually I noticed that she's a very emotional thinker. When she wants something, she doesn't consider the circumstances (whether we can afford it, timing...) and would throw a fit about it until she gets what she wants. I had the conversation with her that it is a problem and wouldn't be sustainable since making decisions in such way could destroy our lives. I on the other hand am very calculated when it comes to making decisions. She acted that way about getting married when we were obviously not financially ready. Thankfully things got better and we finally got married, no big expensive wedding. I felt rushed but it wasn't bad.

After we got married, she started putting on weight. Her friends told her that she was gaining weight and that she needs to look after herself. I had also told her before we got married that I told her that I take care of myself and want her to do so. I was even personally going to the gym with her and cooking healthy meals for her. She eventually told me I'm controlling and that I should let her be.

Communication problems started rising because what I say would always be taken as what she wants to hear or doesn't care. For example, before the marriage, I sat down with her and showed her all our finances, went over the debts and everything, just to find out months later that she didn't even know how much I make and doesn't even remember us talking about finances which made me realize that she wasn't even listening.

Right after marriage she wanted a baby and would cry when I'd mention anything related to having a baby. We weren't ready to have one since she was in the process of getting her degree and I was financially supporting her 100% while she goes to school (She needed to take a few years of school so that she can convert her French law degree and be able to work in the US as a lawyer). I had spoken to her regarding not having a baby until she's settled with her career and we're financially ready. Given that she may do things without thinking much about it, I had also told her that no matter what happens, she shouldn't even think about trapping me and she cried when I said that and said that she'd never do such a thing. Unfortunately, she did get pregnant. The pregnancy completely messed me up because now I had to think about all the financial issues ahead. Her pregnancy was very bad so she had to quit school and was constantly sick. I was by her side through the process but emotionally I wasn't as I was very stressed. We had debt, hospital bills, student loans... and our sex life died. We almost didn't have sex during the pregnancy mainly because I just wasn't sexually attracted to the fact that she was pregnant and was constantly vomiting. Luckily she doesn't gain pregnancy weight and had the same weight as she did before the pregnancy so her weight gain was due to a poor lifestyle. After the birth, she stayed home to take care of the baby.

At this point I had lost my attraction to her though I still love her and want to make things work. Even though I never said anything, she could feel like I wasn't into the sex the way I used to be. I would have a hard time getting aroused and lost interest in sex with her though I would still try my best. She brought it up and I told her it's just the stress. Eventually I told her that I lost attraction and she told me that I don't love her anymore and if I really did love her I would be attracted to her no matter what. She had stretch marks and her breasts became saggy which I told her I didn't care about and that doesn't bother me at all. It's just the weight that I have an issue with. After I told her, while she was overseas visiting family, not in a mean way or putting her down, she decided that it's better if we get a divorce and said that she's staying at her mom's. She then blocked me and avoided talking to me for 2 days. Eventually I spoke to her and told her she got my support in her weight loss journey and I am here to work on things with her the way she worked through things with me when I had my condition. She told me that I am deflecting and that I am in denial about my sexual issues which have been fixed but she's convinced herself that somehow I have a sexual disorder that I don't want to admit. She also told me that she has no intention of changing her diet or losing weight and if I can't be attracted to her the way she is I should simply just get a divorce. When I had my condition, she told me that it makes her not want to have sex with me and despite the fact that it did hurt that she said that, I understood and I worked things out. On top of all that, she blames me for not being able to finish school and start her career which I do not believe is my fault.

I really don't want a divorce but I am willing to go through it if needed. I have been very unhappy for the last 2 years and so has she. She said that gaining weight shouldn't deprive her of happiness and that she deserves a husband who always is attracted to her no matter what and I also do deserve to have a wife that I am attracted to. I cannot be in a position where I have to think about another woman to get aroused when I am with my wife. Communication issues have piled up to the point where I don't even want to have to discuss serious things concerning our couple because if it's not what she wants to hear it turns into her getting upset. I do not trust her anymore after the baby trap despite the fact that I love our child to death.

I would be great to hear your takes on this and I am looking forward to enlightening responses.

,Marriage,"Hi everyone.

My wife and I got married back in June, and since then I’ve been struggling to wear my wedding ring a fair bit of the time due to comfort.

As a guy I’ve never worn jewellery before, especially rings, so it’s very new territory for me.  I’ve been wearing it as much as possibly both at home and out, but most days I find I need to take it off for a few hours to stretch my hand a bit. It’s never uncomfortable due to tightness and always slips off with a little bit of resistance, it’s just the presence of something on my hand.

I was hoping after a few months I’d be used to wearing it for much longer now, but I’m hoping someone here might have some secret sage advice or clever trick to make it more comfortable to wear? Or do I just have to let my brain figure it out on it’s own?

It’s an 8mm tungsten carbide ring if that helps at all.

,Marriage,"Looking for some advice for dealing with a pathological liar. We are married for 6 years with two small children. 

My wife is a pretty big drinker. She drink 1-2 times a week. But when she does, she goes all out and drinks until the wee hours most of the time.

We had some issues early in the marriage. I caught her texting two of her ex boyfriends. There was also one time where we were fighting and I found her drinking at bars with her friends, talking to guys. We addressed it and moved on. But I continued to be suspicious about her honesty. I trusted her, but was cautious. I had also caught her in a few other lies but nothing that was serious. She is also very frisky when intoxicated. She makes bad decisions when shes drunk. She has a DUI. 

Two weeks ago i caught her lying about money. She opened up a new credit card, put hundreds of dollars on it, buying clothes and items for herself. I found the clothes in her car and asked about them. She said "" i dont have to tell you everything, its none of your business"". If she had asked to buy things I would have been fine with it. I don't care about the money ( well a little) What i care about is the dishonesty.

My wife has been working a new job and for the first time, she is making more money than me. The job requires trips to other cities pretty often. 

We talked out the lying about clothes and she left for her trip. She called me in the early evening and said she was going to dinner. She called me later that right around 10:30pm. She said she was taking her sleep meds and was going to bed. 

I didn't buy it. Call it stalking or whatever- but I was going with my gut feelings here and needed to know. now. I tracked her iphone to a bar around midnight. I continued tracking until 2am until I fell asleep. The next morning I got a text from her around 9AM saying she didn't feel good.

I didn't say anything at first. But a few days later when she got back in town I asked about her trip.

I asked where she went to dinner. She gets confused and says uh uh uh uh uh I didn't go to dinner. She admits she went to a bar with a bunch of male coworkers. I asked why she lied and she accused me of being jealous that I was ""too stupid to do her job."" We have barely spoken since.

Of course I would never get concrete proof she slept with someone. But if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck... During previous arguments, she has stated that ""if i did cheat on you, i wouldn't tell you"". 

I am not a possessive husband. But I am not OK with my wife drinking with men at bars late at night. I don't think most husbands are. Girls nights are whatever.

Even if she didn't cheat, the #1 thing in a relationship, honesty, is broken.She has a few more ""trips"" coming up soon and the same thing will happen. Drinking at bars with men.

,Marriage,"How did you approach it? Did it ever become an ultimatum? Looking for advice please. 

Let me start by saying, I (F, 30) love my husband (33), I’m in love with him, and he’s my best friend. We click. I want to be married to his complicated, sweet ass forever and always. I couldn't imagine life without him. 

My DH is an amazing guy. He’s incredibly sweet, boisterous, fun, and is the type to make friends wherever we go. However, he also has unchecked depression, ADD, OCD, and addiction issues. He’s had the misfortune of having quite a few people in life pass away, including his best friend. He also comes from a culture that doesn’t give credence to mental health, so his emotions usually go unacknowledged by his parents and siblings. He has an alcohol dependency problem. He says it’s because he has no other way to unwind when he comes home in the evening. This is the only way he manages stress. 

I’ve brought up therapy, but it just never happens. The times I bring it up, he accuses me of nagging him about it. He’s not opposed to it. In fact, he pushed me to get therapy early on in our relationship. I trusted his advice and now, years of therapy of medication later, I feel good. Now, I wish I could do the same for him. We have great health insurance and we live a really comfortable life. He could see a therapist once a week if he wanted to. Sometimes, I just bring him to my therapist during “couples counseling” and let him talk to her. She’s facilitated many conversation between us and has told him that its time for him to seek his own therapist so he can get individualized therapy. He'll nod and agree with her, then blow it off as soon as we head home.  

I’ve stopped trying to have the “therapy” conversation with him because he gets defensive. So now I check in with him in the evenings, and a simple, “hey, how are you feeling? I just wanted to ask because you seem really quiet/sad/stressed lately” turns into an argument and I get shut out. Try as I might to remind him that he’s not alone and that I’m here to help and we have the resources, he just won’t acknowledge how bad it is for him, and now our marriage.

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying, I (F, 30) love my husband (33), I’m in love with him, and he’s my best friend. We click. I want to be married to his complicated, sweet ass forever and always. I couldn&amp;#39;t imagine life without him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My DH is an amazing guy. He’s incredibly sweet, boisterous, fun, and is the type to make friends wherever we go. However, he also has unchecked depression, ADD, OCD, and addiction issues. He’s had the misfortune of having quite a few people in life pass away, including his best friend. He also comes from a culture that doesn’t give credence to mental health, so his emotions usually go unacknowledged by his parents and siblings. He has an alcohol dependency problem. He says it’s because he has no other way to unwind when he comes home in the evening. This is the only way he manages stress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve brought up therapy, but it just never happens. The times I bring it up, he accuses me of nagging him about it. He’s not opposed to it. In fact, he pushed me to get therapy early on in our relationship. I trusted his advice and now, years of therapy of medication later, I feel good. Now, I wish I could do the same for him. We have great health insurance and we live a really comfortable life. He could see a therapist once a week if he wanted to. Sometimes, I just bring him to my therapist during “couples counseling” and let him talk to her. She’s facilitated many conversation between us and has told him that its time for him to seek his own therapist so he can get individualized therapy. He&amp;#39;ll nod and agree with her, then blow it off as soon as we head home.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve stopped trying to have the “therapy” conversation with him because he gets defensive. So now I check in with him in the evenings, and a simple, “hey, how are you feeling? I just wanted to ask because you seem really quiet/sad/stressed lately” turns into an argument and I get shut out. Try as I might to remind him that he’s not alone and that I’m here to help and we have the resources, he just won’t acknowledge how bad it is for him, and now our marriage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel helpless because I’m watching my young, handsome husband slowly lose to life.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Hi All- I’m constantly frustrated with my husband. Deep down I know he is a good person but I’m having a hard time with our relationship especially now after having a baby less than a year ago.  I find myself in a constant state of pissed off and irritated and I don’t enjoy those feelings. 

For some history we have been together over 10 years and have been married three years.  We both started college at the same time and he is still in school (which is one of my major issues with him).  I graduated from college almost 7 years ago.  He started and then took about a 1.5 year break then started school again 2 years ago.  I’m glad he is trying to finish and get a degree but I just feel so done with this phase of life.  I feel that everything hinges on him finishing school.  We can’t financially improve our situation until he finishes school (we should then be able to get a home, pay off debt, and maybe look forward to having another baby).  

I don’t know how to improve my attitude.  I want to improve my attitude since we are married and I do love him, but I feel like he is so lax on school and doesn’t I stand the urgency of finishing his schooling.  Side note, he was diagnosed with ADD in January 2016.

,Marriage,"My wife and I have been together for 5 years and married for almost 2. We have two kids together, 3 and 1.5.  Throughout the majority of our relationship, she has been absolutely amazing. She was always so caring, sweet, and would do anything and everything to make me happy. And the same goes for me to her. 

Somewhere down the line, things got crappy. It wasn't long after our youngest child was born when it started. She got to where she would get snappy about everything in a very nasty way. Sex went from usually 4/7 days a week to twice a month. She started ""forgetting"" to wear her wedding ring, and now she doesn't wear it at all even if I ask her to put it on. It is like she stopped caring about me.

She started a new job earlier this year. She made a guy friend who is this tall muscled up dude. I'm okay with her having guy friends. I'm not that insecure. But this seems... different. She started going to the gym with him a few times a week. She works night shift, 2 on 2 off, so she normally stays up pretty late on her off days. They meet up at the gym at midnight and she doesn't get home until 4 or after. The gym is only 5 minutes away and there is usually no one there in the middle of the night. This obviously makes me uncomfortable, and I'm sure most people would feel the same way. I expressed to her that i feel uncomfortable with her staying out so long with another man that I've never even met, and requested that they go during the day and not stay for 4 hours. She didn't agree to that, and used the night shift excuse. I can't tell you how many times I have asked her to stay home and watch a movie with me instead, and get a big ole fat no from her. Another weird thing is that she usually acts tired and exhausted when she is home, but as soon as it's time to get ready to go to the gym she gets a pep in her step.

As far as sex goes, it is pretty much non-existent these days. She claims that she just isn't a sexual person, even though we used to have sex all the time. One weird thing is that after she met the dude mentioned earlier, while we were having sex she told me she likes it when her hips are grabbed hard from behind. I've never really done that, and I am her first.

About two months ago, I asked what in the hell has happened to our relationship and why she has been acting the way she has. She told me she doesn't love me anymore and wants a divorce. I asked her if I mistreated her and she said no, she just fell out of love. My philosophy is that no married couple has a strong, passionate love for each other 24/7 for the rest of their lives. There will always be rough patches, and it is up to the married couple to identify what the problems are and fix them. Especially if they have children together.

With ALL OF THAT being said, I want marriage counseling. I told her and she hasn't really given me an answer or anything. Do you guys think that marriage counseling could help fix this sort of situation? I've never been to any sort of counseling, so I'm kind of skeptical of it's effectiveness.

P.S. I'm sorry for the long, scrambled backstory.

She was always so caring, sweet, and would do anything and everything to make me happy. And the same goes for me to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere down the line, things got crappy. It wasn&amp;#39;t long after our youngest child was born when it started. She got to where she would get snappy about everything in a very nasty way. Sex went from usually 4/7 days a week to twice a month. She started &amp;quot;forgetting&amp;quot; to wear her wedding ring, and now she doesn&amp;#39;t wear it at all even if I ask her to put it on. It is like she stopped caring about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She started a new job earlier this year. She made a guy friend who is this tall muscled up dude. I&amp;#39;m okay with her having guy friends. I&amp;#39;m not that insecure. But this seems... different. She started going to the gym with him a few times a week. She works night shift, 2 on 2 off, so she normally stays up pretty late on her off days. They meet up at the gym at midnight and she doesn&amp;#39;t get home until 4 or after. The gym is only 5 minutes away and there is usually no one there in the middle of the night. This obviously makes me uncomfortable, and I&amp;#39;m sure most people would feel the same way. I expressed to her that i feel uncomfortable with her staying out so long with another man that I&amp;#39;ve never even met, and requested that they go during the day and not stay for 4 hours. She didn&amp;#39;t agree to that, and used the night shift excuse. I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many times I have asked her to stay home and watch a movie with me instead, and get a big ole fat no from her. Another weird thing is that she usually acts tired and exhausted when she is home, but as soon as it&amp;#39;s time to get ready to go to the gym she gets a pep in her step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as sex goes, it is pretty much non-existent these days. She claims that she just isn&amp;#39;t a sexual person, even though we used to have sex all the time. One weird thing is that after she met the dude mentioned earlier, while we were having sex she told me she likes it when her hips are grabbed hard from behind. I&amp;#39;ve never really done that, and I am her first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two months ago, I asked what in the hell has happened to our relationship and why she has been acting the way she has. She told me she doesn&amp;#39;t love me anymore and wants a divorce. I asked her if I mistreated her and she said no, she just fell out of love. My philosophy is that no married couple has a strong, passionate love for each other 24/7 for the rest of their lives. There will always be rough patches, and it is up to the married couple to identify what the problems are and fix them. Especially if they have children together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With ALL OF THAT being said, I want marriage counseling. I told her and she hasn&amp;#39;t really given me an answer or anything. Do you guys think that marriage counseling could help fix this sort of situation? I&amp;#39;ve never been to any sort of counseling, so I&amp;#39;m kind of skeptical of it&amp;#39;s effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. I&amp;#39;m sorry for the long, scrambled backstory. All of this has me stressed to the max, and I have no one to talk to about it because my family loves her and I don&amp;#39;t want to get them involved just in case this gets fixed one day.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Hi everyone,

I'm(F.26y) not really sure how all of this work since it is my first time on reddit but I need some advice. I apologize in advice for the long post and typos.

I've been married two years now (together for 3 years). Last year my husband (M.31y)admitted that when we started dating (long distance relationship) he was already in a relationship and was living with that person who also happened to be a colleague from work. At the time when we started talking I asked him if he had someone and he said no. When he told me about her last year I felt betrayed because he had been lying to me for two years at that point. So for weeks i was distant because i needed to rethink everything. Also the fact that they still work together and that he sees her everyday was hard to digest.

4 weeks ago, i found out that around that time he told me about her, him and her reconnected. She started texting him and calling him. He had to unblock her number because she told someone at work that he blocked her and that person called them immature so he felt the need to unblock her. She took that opportunity to started texting him and calling him. I checked our phones records and she texting him everyday throughout the day and was calling him multiple times a day. He was calling her back too. He deleted all texts and calls so I know all that from checking the phone records. ( He work outside while she stays in the office so he is able to use his phone all day)

He told me she would call to complain about work, gossip, talk about her professional projects, her family issues. ask him advice about people she was dating, people at work she wanted to sleep with. He said that nothing physical happened, they never see each other outside of work and barely had time to talk to each other at work. He said when he told me about her a year ago we weren't good so she was a distraction but it's spiraled out of control and became someting bigger that he wanted. He said he regrets letting it happened. It is hard for me to believe him since it lasted a whole year and he always made sure to delete everything before he comes home. He said he felt guilty for leaving her ( she doesn't know that, i didn't know either at the time) for me so he felt the need to make it up to her by being her friends and listening to her and givign her advice. He was doing the same thing when he was with her, He was still talking to his other ex and would his her advice and listen to her etc...

This is not the only issue. I also found out that he was doing the same thing with another colleague at the same. She is older than him (40y), married with 4 kids. He started talking to her more recently (Since January). She asked him for his number and started doing the same thing his ex was doing, text, call. He also said that she was calling to talk about the people at work she has beef with, gossip about work, but she also told him about her life. He swears he wasn't trying to get with her, that he wasn't interested in her like that and she was just a distraction form our issues and just like the ex it spiraled out of control.

He said that he hoped that they would both just go away, that eventually when we have kids and he leaves for paternity leave and don't speak to them for weeks they would'nt try to talk to him when he go back etc....

The whole situation made me uncomfortable. I told him to block his ex and the colleague. He called the ex in front of me after i insisted since i didn't trust that he would do it. He did and taold her to stop texting and calling him. He also told her the day after face to face. He refused to call his colleague and texted her instead, he din't want to call ler late at night on a Sunday ( I found out everything on a Sunday night) since she is married and i guess didn't want to get her in trouble.

I really don't know what to do. I am an overthinker so i have million of questions to ask him but none of his responses are satisfying since i lost trust in him. I also grew up seeing my dad cheat on my mom for their entire marriage so it's hard not to feel like i'm going to be in the same situation.

Before all that we were very good and were talking about having kids, started savings for the kids etc.... But now i don't know. I still love him but I don't know if staying is the right decision. I feel like i'm too invested emotionally to make a rational decision. Also the fact that these two people are still working with him give me anxiety. i don't trust that they will not try to come back into his life. I forgot to say that he said that his colleague asked him if she could talk to me to apologize because she would'nt like if someone was talking to her husband the way she was talking to mine, she also apologize for causing issues in our household. The ex just had a petty reaction and said "" I wasn't going to call you or text you anyways"".

I don't expect you guys to make a decision for me but i need guidance.

Thank you in advance

,Marriage,"Tl;Dr: My first marriage was very emotionally/sexually abusive. My current husband knows this, but seems reluctant to hear any sort of (even minor) detail about it. I know it’s probably hard to hear, but I feel alone because he doesn’t know much. 

I’m hoping for some outside perspective here. Throwaway because my husband knows my reddit and him seeing this is not the way I want to start this conversation. Also posting here for married folks’ perspective. 

Things haven’t been very easy for my husband and I the last month or so. We’ve committed to having a lot of hard conversations and working on fixing our relationship. Right now I’m content with that. 

Before our troubles began, I started going to a therapist to discuss my last marriage. My last marriage was to an emotionally and sexually abusive man. My current husband knows this, and I’ve been very detailed in the emotional abuse descriptions over the years, but I’ve always been a little less forthcoming about the sexual abuse. He knows it happened. I honestly don’t remember what else beyond that I’ve told him. 

Anyway, most of my therapy has been focused on finally processing the repeated rape I experienced during my last marriage. One of my goals I set for therapy was the ability to share what had happened to me with my husband. I even told him about this goal when I began (maybe two months ago?), and he seemed supportive. 

Lately, however, if I ever even start to broach the subject, he changes the subject without even acknowledging what I was talking about, or if I’m lucky, I get a “I’m sorry you’ve been stressed about things”. I know he has a lot on his own plate right now, with him starting his own counseling. I guess I just feel so alone, and like I’m handling everything by myself. I don’t mind waiting to tell him, but lately I’ve been getting nervous that he might not want to hear about it at all. I don’t like feeling like I’m hiding it from him, it makes me feel ashamed and I don’t want to feel ashamed for something I didn’t do anymore.

,Marriage,"**Part One, The Snap**

A few folks have asked me to post my story. There are many stories out there like this. You think to yourself, “this can’t happen to me”, until it is you walking in these shoes. Someone also asked if it is possible to reconcile after anger/rage etc. and the answer is yes.

The moment when it finally hit me, “I love you, but I’m not in love with you”. My wife snapped. There were so many warning signs. How did I get here? Do I deserve this? How dare she! Later on, I would learn that this was not the end, rather a cry for help. This wisdom I gained was a slow arduous battle. At many times it was two steps forward, one step back. This is the beginning of how I went from knowing about God, to walking with Jesus.

I grew up in a big city, blue collar household, the youngest of 3 siblings. I felt more like an only child, because they were all half-siblings. Only 2 ever lived with me and they were out of the house before I hit middle school. My mom always had us in church. I knew of God. I always believed; that was never an issue. By high school age my mom moved us to a non-denominational bible teaching Christian church. Prior to that we bounced around Baptist, Lutheran, and Presbyterian denominations. I even went to a Catholic grade school, but identified as protestant. This new church was much more real to me though, the sr. pastor and children’s pastor were very good. At 15 I confessed that I was saved (I believed Jesus died for me), however I never got baptized. I was too shy to do that in front of others.

When I went to college, I moved further away from that church and never looked for a replacement. I spent most of my time studying for skills that would “make me rich” and getting trashed at house parties. A few years before graduating, I moved back to the area and started attending again sporadically. Some Sundays I’d show up hung over. You would even find me there Wednesday night, doing verse-by-verse study. I would go with my girlfriend too, like it was a family event. I lived most of my young adult life following the parts of the bible that I wanted to, and ignored the parts that went against the grain: pre-marital sex, booze, worshiping money. I had a lot of pride. Later, this pride would drop me to my knees.

By the time I turned 30, I was ready for a change. I dumped my long-time girlfriend and headed out on an exotic vacation. I quickly met a much more beautiful woman and was completely captivated by her. Afterwards we began a long-distance relationship. 6 months in, I had packed up everything I owned to move in with her and her 3-year-old son. 18 months later we were married. In about another year we had our first child together (planned), then 15 months later child #2 (not planned). 

During this time I: moved us from the townhouse to an apartment, then bought a 6,000 sqft house, paid for the wedding, bought a $45k monster SUV, furnished the entire house, hired a contractor to finish the basement, re-landscaped the backyard with a fence and all, and ensured every vacation and Christmas present that was requested was fulfilled. I was as prideful and entitled as any man you could think of. “I did this on my own, I deserve this, I deserve that, she is low, I am high, without me she would be nothing, yada yada yada”.

I failed to recognize the warning signs when we conceived our 2nd unplanned child. This is when it started going downhill. However, the snap wouldn’t happen until 3 years later. We were in a vicious cycle, much of what you would describe a pursuer – distancer relationship. I would work 55-60 hr weeks, and then expect intimacy in return without building any connection. Bad habits were formed on both sides, all leading to resentment. After 3 years of doing this, our relationship started going sharply downhill. She was distancing from me, and I was too pre-occupied with work to see it.

If you don’t know what Satan’s lies are, do some research on a concept called Spiritual Warfare. We were indeed in a war. Here are the lies I believed: I’ve got my drinking under control, I’m entitled to whatever I want because I make a lot of money, more money will fix things, she was divorced before so she won’t let this marriage fail, porn is a reasonable substitute when I don’t get what I want. All lies. How could I be so stupid? I’m sure she subscribed to a laundry list of lies as well, in fact I know she did because in the next part I will list some of them! You’ll laugh because if you’re in a struggling marriage, you’ve actually said the words yourself.

One night as I was sleeping in a separate bedroom, the Holy Spirit intervened. For some weird reason, I felt compelled to check the phone records. I had never done anything like this before, and I was shocked! She had been spending hours upon hours on the phone with another man. Later I would come to learn that this was a form of emotional affair, or in other words, a way for a woman to get her emotional needs fulfilled by someone else because her husband wasn’t doing his job.

I confronted her. She finally addressed me directly. Oh, those dreadful words: “I love you, but I’m not in love with you”. This would be the beginning of my journey, where I would learn to walk with Jesus and not just know about bible stories.

**Part Two, The Change**

The next 7 months was quite the ordeal. It felt like a trial by error. I would go down one path thinking I was onto the solution only to stumble and be sent flying backwards. God was trying to teach me something. I lost almost 15 lbs. and couldn’t concentrate at work. Everything was going downhill. It was only in the times that I followed the way of Jesus that I would spring forward. Every time I went against His way, I would fall into a trap. One thing was for certain, I was out to fix this, because that’s what men do, we fix things. In my narrow-mindedness I kept thinking reconciliation was a week away, which only fueled my frustration. One week would become two, then a month, then a season, more than half a year in total.

The Holy Spirit intervened a second time in the early stages of this. While I was driving to a work meeting, I had this moment of clarity. It was as if a voice said “If you follow God’s way, then things work out and make sense, it is the only way”. These two interactions with the Holy Spirit would send me on a mission to find relief in Jesus, and even while doing that I would stumble on worldly wisdom.

Here are the things that did not work and set me back. Isn’t it funny how these are all condemned by Jesus’ teaching? Somehow in my brain these seemed to be rationale at the time. Don’t fall into the trap!

* Threatening divorce
* Yelling, arguing, trying to have the “big talk”, using logic for everything
* Using apps like Tinder and Bumble to try to ease into an affair or find the next woman, both while in town and out of town for work
* Reading books and theory on techniques that are self-centered, by and large on manipulating your spouse: No More Mr. Nice Guy, Married Man Sex Life Primer, married red pill rhetoric.
* The talkaboutmarriage.com website where a group of the few same people spread negative commentary about everyone’s wife having an affair and how there is no way to save your marriage.
* At one point I had all of the divorce prep ready to go, all I had to do was click a button and she would get served.

It wasn’t all one-sided, take a look at these wicked things that my wife said to me. Notice some of the lies that Satan was spreading.

* I don’t love you; I’ll never love you; I don’t want to make a connection with you.
* You make my skin crawl.
* You remind me of a cult, a bible-thumping holy roller.
* We should just get a divorce.
* This was a mistake, we got married too fast.
* The kids will be happier if we divorce.
* I need to get a job so I can get the #$%\^ out of here.
* You were the ‘safe’ option, I’m not attracted to you.
* She called my baptism bulls###.
* When her close family caught wind of this, they sided with me, saying she did not deserve the grace that I was about to pour out fueled by the strength of God.

Here are the resources that helped me.

* I got baptized. I committed to following Jesus for the rest of my days, although out of the gate I would stumble several times, but He never gave up on me.
* I read about a half-dozen books on communication and relationships, some of which are Christian-based, my favorites were: His Needs, Her Needs, The 5 Love Languages, The Love Dare, Beyond the Battle: A Man's Guide to his Identity in Christ in an Oversexualized World, and Men are from Mars… I also bought 3 or 4 of those ‘save your marriage’ PDFs, which were also pretty helpful on a common sense level.
* I was also heavy into devotionals on the bible app. It was giving me lifeblood I needed to survive the day. The most common topics I hit were: marriage, manhood, hope, perseverance, patience, love, anger, anxiety, and depression. I finished over 50 devotionals in just a couple months.
* I had other people praying for me. I went to people I could trust, and then they told other people. There had to be hundreds of people praying from all over the world. Some were in my church, some were in churches in other states where my family was from, some were even international that I had met on worthychristian.com. 
* I joined a men’s group. I had a group of a dozen guys that had my back and also weren’t afraid to point out what I was doing wrong. They spoke truth and they prayed for me.
* The counseling pastor at church referred me to a counselor. This would make it my 2nd counselor. This woman was so much better equipped to handle my situation and she was blessed with discernment. She told me truths I could not see for myself, which were hugely uplifting.

And here are the things I learned that would begin to unblock my prayers, because prayer is more effective coming from a righteous man.

* Changed priorities from Me, Work, Family to God, Wife, Kids, Work, and myself last.
* Completely stopped worrying about money.
* Let go of my resentment.
* Quit binge drinking.
* Quit lusting after anything walking down the street, porn, and even unhealthy views of my own wife.
* Dropped the pride and stopped measuring my accomplishments against my wife. I stopped scoring her with things like “well I’m being such a good Christian and she isn’t changing at all” this is all pride and it is senseless.
* Stopped ignoring the needy and donated to the poor and to the church. Jesus did not come here to be served He came here **to** serve.
* I learned to take joy in my trial, because it would grow me into a stronger man and result in the marriage that I really wanted.

So, I’m not perfect, no one is, but I answered the bell. I committed to change the things the Holy Spirit convicted me of, and now all I had to do was to wait for God’s plan for my marriage to unfold. Would we reconcile? Would she leave me anyway?

**Part Three, 7 Breakthroughs**

I can clearly remember each breakthrough, which was a stepping stone to the next breakthrough. When you put it all together you get a miraculous story about God’s omnipresence in our lives. This is why The Bible teaches much about hope and trust. If you can hold on, let your anxiety be overcome by hope, you can outlast the struggle.

1. There were some nights when I would lie face down in bed next to my stonewalling wife, crushed emotionally. I would cry out (silently) in prayer for relief. On a few occasions I could feel two hands rest gently on my back and a voice or thought that would say “I got you”. Then a feeling of relief would come over me.
2. The next thing I cannot completely recite, but there was a night when a lot of wisdom was revealed to me that described how I got into this situation, what my wife was feeling, and a way past it. It is hard to explain with words, but it was a mixture of visions and clarity that set my heart at ease. I also for the first time truly connected with what Jesus did for us. This rocky season was an analogy to Jesus’ burden carrying that cross. When I thought my marital struggle was too much to bear, I would compare it to Him being whipped and beaten. I could picture it in my mind. I could FEEL it. Suddenly, my privileged suburban life with the distant wife didn’t seem that bad. 
3. A few months into this ordeal, my wife finally landed a job. It was the perfect job. She made enough extra money for us to really stop worrying about money even though I had given that concern to God at least 6 weeks prior. I had also started tithing to the church before this happened. Its amazing how generosity can be rewarded. It was also a challenging job for her and I believe this was on purpose (part of her trial). The commute was very painful and her boss was a wicked micro manager. The pay was reasonably low enough where it was obvious that my ability to provide financially still carried a lot of value. This new role for her allowed me to continue the practice of my revised priorities and it also forced her out of falling into the trap of idle hands.
4. Next up I embarked on another business trip. I was still hurting pretty bad from my circumstance. The first round of couples counseling failed. We had been trying to date each other again and do fun things, but it often came off contrived. I know throughout the process our faith wavered on various occasions. This time on the business trip, I made a point to not cloud my mind with the temptation of an affair. I went out for a nice dinner, kept to myself, and kept on reading my devotions. That night I got on my knees and prayed a very simple but effective prayer. This time I did not barrage God with a bunch of specific requests; I did not push my agenda. I buried my head at the edge of the bed and just said “I don’t know what to do, I’m completely lost, but I trust in you, and I lay this at the cross, let Your will be done”. I did not say goodnight to my wife that night, in fact I didn’t communicate anything since the plane had taken off, which was not our usual cadence. What would happen next would be a series of events that would lead to reconciliation.  
The next morning something strange happened. My wife called me at 5 in the morning, earlier than typical for her to be up, flustered because the fire alarm was going off. She was at home alone tasked with getting 3 kids off to school and then commuting to her horrible job. Needless to say, stress for her went from 0 to 60 pretty fast. We had a nice chat about the alarm situation, and then we both went about our day. I had a gut feeling that this would be the beginning of her opening up, to lean into my manhood, which would then allow us to re-develop the closeness we had lost. To further cement this, she called me out of the blue while I was driving home from the airport. She was very concerned about a cold that I had been developing. Her next act of service was to schedule me a dr. appointment, run out to get me my favorite meal, and have it all ready for me when I got home. If that wasn’t enough, she also started talking about a new TV show “that we should watch” together. Acts of service, quality time, oh my. I was grinning ear to ear at the languages of love being demonstrated.
5. Six months into the journey, I have passed every mini-milestone I could think of. Surely this could not continue on, but if it did, I was ok, I was really in a good place just waiting and trusting God. I was doing my best to keep loving unconditionally. When I got down and Satan would attack me with his lies, I would fight back with prayer and self-study. I banded together with my Christian Brothers. Nothing could stop me, or I should say, nothing can stop God. He can move mountains, anything is possible. While setting out on another business trip, literally minutes before I was about to board and lose service, my wife texts me. She reached out to an old friend, a follower of Jesus, and this woman spoke truth. If you go back to the part where I talked about having hundreds of people pray for me, one of the prayers being led by my grandmother, who has brought many to Jesus, called for someone to cross my wife’s path and speak truth. Her brilliant prayer was answered. My wife confessed that her friend had gone through a similar trial and that she would be willing to go back to counseling. Furthermore, she went on to say that she was committed to the marriage and knew without a doubt that we would get past this. Then she wrapped it up with saying she LOVED ME. Tell me you didn’t just fall on the floor.
6. About another month or so of reconnecting went by. In the next breakthrough my wife initiated a romantic trip. It was her idea that we should drop the kids off with the grandparents and go away for the weekend. We had such a wonderful, romantic time, and rekindled our intimacy. For the next few weeks I was floating on clouds.  
7. When you do God’s will he pours out blessings. If reconciliation wasn’t enough, my wife found a new job with no commute, making way more money, with a group of level-headed women that are really easy to work with. I believe God paved this way for her as a blessing to following through with reconciliation and delivered her from the wickedness of the old job. Now we have a new set up where we can continue to strengthen our marriage, manage the day-to-day of raising kids, and give back to the community.

**Part Four, Life is a Marathon not a Race**

Many will hear me warn of the honeymoon period effect. The cool thing about reconciliation is that you experience a second honeymoon period. It wouldn’t last however; life just isn’t like that. While I was enjoying the healed marriage, I certainly did a small amount of backsliding, just enough to get far enough away from Jesus to recognize I was repeating some bad habits. But this time around I had much more wisdom and basic principles. With my antenna up, I’m able to stop myself and change course. This is why you’ll hear so many Jesus followers talk about their daily routines. How do we stay close to God, so we can benefit from his wisdom? Well a person that strives for that is praying every day, reading devotionals, studying the bible, active in a small group, active in church, serving the community, tithing to the church, living righteously, cutting off any bad habits, and trusting God completely. It is a daily exercise that strengthens you each day.

Right now, my primary concern in our marriage is intimacy. I know there is a deeper level of connection available to us. I can’t put my finger on exactly what it is, maybe old wounds are still healing, or maybe each of us still have some changing to do. While digging into this concern, I am convicted of the way I tithe. There is an analogy there. Why should I expect to receive so abundantly when I give so sparingly? The next two big rocks in my spiritual development are to become a joyful giver and a more vocal spiritual leader in my household. I feel that these two things will break more chains that are holding us back. I was even able to bring this concern to my wife directly in a healthy way, where Jesus helped guide me in finding the words. The result was so much more effective than the things I had tried a year ago, you know why? I sought council from God first. I prayed and waited. I executed his agenda, not my own, in order to glorify Him, not myself. Since then our affection has grown in frequency and quality, and each day I plan to keep cultivating it to take our marriage to new heights.

There is a third big rock and that is where this testimony comes from. Many people like me and went to the internet for advice on their struggling marriage, and there is a lot of really bad advice out there. Let this be a crusade against the lies that Satan spreads so that we may keep our families and children together.

With God anything is possible and love never fails.",t2_40hn9act,False,,0,False,Jesus Saved My Marriage,[],r/Marriage,False,6,,0,,False,t3_dlgutw,False,dark,,public,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,self,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1571774221.0,text,6,,text,self.Marriage,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part One, The Snap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few folks have asked me to post my story. There are many stories out there like this. You think to yourself, “this can’t happen to me”, until it is you walking in these shoes. Someone also asked if it is possible to reconcile after anger/rage etc. and the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment when it finally hit me, “I love you, but I’m not in love with you”. My wife snapped. There were so many warning signs. How did I get here? Do I deserve this? How dare she! Later on, I would learn that this was not the end, rather a cry for help. This wisdom I gained was a slow arduous battle. At many times it was two steps forward, one step back. This is the beginning of how I went from knowing about God, to walking with Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a big city, blue collar household, the youngest of 3 siblings. I felt more like an only child, because they were all half-siblings. Only 2 ever lived with me and they were out of the house before I hit middle school. My mom always had us in church. I knew of God. I always believed; that was never an issue. By high school age my mom moved us to a non-denominational bible teaching Christian church. Prior to that we bounced around Baptist, Lutheran, and Presbyterian denominations. I even went to a Catholic grade school, but identified as protestant. This new church was much more real to me though, the sr. pastor and children’s pastor were very good. At 15 I confessed that I was saved (I believed Jesus died for me), however I never got baptized. I was too shy to do that in front of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went to college, I moved further away from that church and never looked for a replacement. I spent most of my time studying for skills that would “make me rich” and getting trashed at house parties. A few years before graduating, I moved back to the area and started attending again sporadically. Some Sundays I’d show up hung over. You would even find me there Wednesday night, doing verse-by-verse study. I would go with my girlfriend too, like it was a family event. I lived most of my young adult life following the parts of the bible that I wanted to, and ignored the parts that went against the grain: pre-marital sex, booze, worshiping money. I had a lot of pride. Later, this pride would drop me to my knees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I turned 30, I was ready for a change. I dumped my long-time girlfriend and headed out on an exotic vacation. I quickly met a much more beautiful woman and was completely captivated by her. Afterwards we began a long-distance relationship. 6 months in, I had packed up everything I owned to move in with her and her 3-year-old son. 18 months later we were married. In about another year we had our first child together (planned), then 15 months later child #2 (not planned). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time I: moved us from the townhouse to an apartment, then bought a 6,000 sqft house, paid for the wedding, bought a $45k monster SUV, furnished the entire house, hired a contractor to finish the basement, re-landscaped the backyard with a fence and all, and ensured every vacation and Christmas present that was requested was fulfilled. I was as prideful and entitled as any man you could think of. “I did this on my own, I deserve this, I deserve that, she is low, I am high, without me she would be nothing, yada yada yada”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I failed to recognize the warning signs when we conceived our 2nd unplanned child. This is when it started going downhill. However, the snap wouldn’t happen until 3 years later. We were in a vicious cycle, much of what you would describe a pursuer – distancer relationship. I would work 55-60 hr weeks, and then expect intimacy in return without building any connection. Bad habits were formed on both sides, all leading to resentment. After 3 years of doing this, our relationship started going sharply downhill. She was distancing from me, and I was too pre-occupied with work to see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know what Satan’s lies are, do some research on a concept called Spiritual Warfare. We were indeed in a war. Here are the lies I believed: I’ve got my drinking under control, I’m entitled to whatever I want because I make a lot of money, more money will fix things, she was divorced before so she won’t let this marriage fail, porn is a reasonable substitute when I don’t get what I want. All lies. How could I be so stupid? I’m sure she subscribed to a laundry list of lies as well, in fact I know she did because in the next part I will list some of them! You’ll laugh because if you’re in a struggling marriage, you’ve actually said the words yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night as I was sleeping in a separate bedroom, the Holy Spirit intervened. For some weird reason, I felt compelled to check the phone records. I had never done anything like this before, and I was shocked! She had been spending hours upon hours on the phone with another man. Later I would come to learn that this was a form of emotional affair, or in other words, a way for a woman to get her emotional needs fulfilled by someone else because her husband wasn’t doing his job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I confronted her. She finally addressed me directly. Oh, those dreadful words: “I love you, but I’m not in love with you”. This would be the beginning of my journey, where I would learn to walk with Jesus and not just know about bible stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part Two, The Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next 7 months was quite the ordeal. It felt like a trial by error. I would go down one path thinking I was onto the solution only to stumble and be sent flying backwards. God was trying to teach me something. I lost almost 15 lbs. and couldn’t concentrate at work. Everything was going downhill. It was only in the times that I followed the way of Jesus that I would spring forward. Every time I went against His way, I would fall into a trap. One thing was for certain, I was out to fix this, because that’s what men do, we fix things. In my narrow-mindedness I kept thinking reconciliation was a week away, which only fueled my frustration. One week would become two, then a month, then a season, more than half a year in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit intervened a second time in the early stages of this. While I was driving to a work meeting, I had this moment of clarity. It was as if a voice said “If you follow God’s way, then things work out and make sense, it is the only way”. These two interactions with the Holy Spirit would send me on a mission to find relief in Jesus, and even while doing that I would stumble on worldly wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the things that did not work and set me back. Isn’t it funny how these are all condemned by Jesus’ teaching? Somehow in my brain these seemed to be rationale at the time. Don’t fall into the trap!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threatening divorce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yelling, arguing, trying to have the “big talk”, using logic for everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using apps like Tinder and Bumble to try to ease into an affair or find the next woman, both while in town and out of town for work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading books and theory on techniques that are self-centered, by and large on manipulating your spouse: No More Mr. Nice Guy, Married Man Sex Life Primer, married red pill rhetoric.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The talkaboutmarriage.com website where a group of the few same people spread negative commentary about everyone’s wife having an affair and how there is no way to save your marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At one point I had all of the divorce prep ready to go, all I had to do was click a button and she would get served.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t all one-sided, take a look at these wicked things that my wife said to me. Notice some of the lies that Satan was spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t love you; I’ll never love you; I don’t want to make a connection with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You make my skin crawl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You remind me of a cult, a bible-thumping holy roller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should just get a divorce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was a mistake, we got married too fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The kids will be happier if we divorce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to get a job so I can get the #$%^ out of here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You were the ‘safe’ option, I’m not attracted to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She called my baptism bulls###.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When her close family caught wind of this, they sided with me, saying she did not deserve the grace that I was about to pour out fueled by the strength of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the resources that helped me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got baptized. I committed to following Jesus for the rest of my days, although out of the gate I would stumble several times, but He never gave up on me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read about a half-dozen books on communication and relationships, some of which are Christian-based, my favorites were: His Needs, Her Needs, The 5 Love Languages, The Love Dare, Beyond the Battle: A Man&amp;#39;s Guide to his Identity in Christ in an Oversexualized World, and Men are from Mars… I also bought 3 or 4 of those ‘save your marriage’ PDFs, which were also pretty helpful on a common sense level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was also heavy into devotionals on the bible app. It was giving me lifeblood I needed to survive the day. The most common topics I hit were: marriage, manhood, hope, perseverance, patience, love, anger, anxiety, and depression. I finished over 50 devotionals in just a couple months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had other people praying for me. I went to people I could trust, and then they told other people. There had to be hundreds of people praying from all over the world. Some were in my church, some were in churches in other states where my family was from, some were even international that I had met on worthychristian.com. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I joined a men’s group. I had a group of a dozen guys that had my back and also weren’t afraid to point out what I was doing wrong. They spoke truth and they prayed for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The counseling pastor at church referred me to a counselor. This would make it my 2nd counselor. This woman was so much better equipped to handle my situation and she was blessed with discernment. She told me truths I could not see for myself, which were hugely uplifting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are the things I learned that would begin to unblock my prayers, because prayer is more effective coming from a righteous man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed priorities from Me, Work, Family to God, Wife, Kids, Work, and myself last.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely stopped worrying about money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let go of my resentment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quit binge drinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quit lusting after anything walking down the street, porn, and even unhealthy views of my own wife.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropped the pride and stopped measuring my accomplishments against my wife. I stopped scoring her with things like “well I’m being such a good Christian and she isn’t changing at all” this is all pride and it is senseless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stopped ignoring the needy and donated to the poor and to the church. Jesus did not come here to be served He came here &lt;strong&gt;to&lt;/strong&gt; serve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned to take joy in my trial, because it would grow me into a stronger man and result in the marriage that I really wanted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m not perfect, no one is, but I answered the bell. I committed to change the things the Holy Spirit convicted me of, and now all I had to do was to wait for God’s plan for my marriage to unfold. Would we reconcile? Would she leave me anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part Three, 7 Breakthroughs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can clearly remember each breakthrough, which was a stepping stone to the next breakthrough. When you put it all together you get a miraculous story about God’s omnipresence in our lives. This is why The Bible teaches much about hope and trust. If you can hold on, let your anxiety be overcome by hope, you can outlast the struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were some nights when I would lie face down in bed next to my stonewalling wife, crushed emotionally. I would cry out (silently) in prayer for relief. On a few occasions I could feel two hands rest gently on my back and a voice or thought that would say “I got you”. Then a feeling of relief would come over me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next thing I cannot completely recite, but there was a night when a lot of wisdom was revealed to me that described how I got into this situation, what my wife was feeling, and a way past it. It is hard to explain with words, but it was a mixture of visions and clarity that set my heart at ease. I also for the first time truly connected with what Jesus did for us. This rocky season was an analogy to Jesus’ burden carrying that cross. When I thought my marital struggle was too much to bear, I would compare it to Him being whipped and beaten. I could picture it in my mind. I could FEEL it. Suddenly, my privileged suburban life with the distant wife didn’t seem that bad. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few months into this ordeal, my wife finally landed a job. It was the perfect job. She made enough extra money for us to really stop worrying about money even though I had given that concern to God at least 6 weeks prior. I had also started tithing to the church before this happened. Its amazing how generosity can be rewarded. It was also a challenging job for her and I believe this was on purpose (part of her trial). The commute was very painful and her boss was a wicked micro manager. The pay was reasonably low enough where it was obvious that my ability to provide financially still carried a lot of value. This new role for her allowed me to continue the practice of my revised priorities and it also forced her out of falling into the trap of idle hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next up I embarked on another business trip. I was still hurting pretty bad from my circumstance. The first round of couples counseling failed. We had been trying to date each other again and do fun things, but it often came off contrived. I know throughout the process our faith wavered on various occasions. This time on the business trip, I made a point to not cloud my mind with the temptation of an affair. I went out for a nice dinner, kept to myself, and kept on reading my devotions. That night I got on my knees and prayed a very simple but effective prayer. This time I did not barrage God with a bunch of specific requests; I did not push my agenda. I buried my head at the edge of the bed and just said “I don’t know what to do, I’m completely lost, but I trust in you, and I lay this at the cross, let Your will be done”. I did not say goodnight to my wife that night, in fact I didn’t communicate anything since the plane had taken off, which was not our usual cadence. What would happen next would be a series of events that would lead to reconciliation.&lt;br/&gt;
The next morning something strange happened. My wife called me at 5 in the morning, earlier than typical for her to be up, flustered because the fire alarm was going off. She was at home alone tasked with getting 3 kids off to school and then commuting to her horrible job. Needless to say, stress for her went from 0 to 60 pretty fast. We had a nice chat about the alarm situation, and then we both went about our day. I had a gut feeling that this would be the beginning of her opening up, to lean into my manhood, which would then allow us to re-develop the closeness we had lost. To further cement this, she called me out of the blue while I was driving home from the airport. She was very concerned about a cold that I had been developing. Her next act of service was to schedule me a dr. appointment, run out to get me my favorite meal, and have it all ready for me when I got home. If that wasn’t enough, she also started talking about a new TV show “that we should watch” together. Acts of service, quality time, oh my. I was grinning ear to ear at the languages of love being demonstrated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six months into the journey, I have passed every mini-milestone I could think of. Surely this could not continue on, but if it did, I was ok, I was really in a good place just waiting and trusting God. I was doing my best to keep loving unconditionally. When I got down and Satan would attack me with his lies, I would fight back with prayer and self-study. I banded together with my Christian Brothers. Nothing could stop me, or I should say, nothing can stop God. He can move mountains, anything is possible. While setting out on another business trip, literally minutes before I was about to board and lose service, my wife texts me. She reached out to an old friend, a follower of Jesus, and this woman spoke truth. If you go back to the part where I talked about having hundreds of people pray for me, one of the prayers being led by my grandmother, who has brought many to Jesus, called for someone to cross my wife’s path and speak truth. Her brilliant prayer was answered. My wife confessed that her friend had gone through a similar trial and that she would be willing to go back to counseling. Furthermore, she went on to say that she was committed to the marriage and knew without a doubt that we would get past this. Then she wrapped it up with saying she LOVED ME. Tell me you didn’t just fall on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About another month or so of reconnecting went by. In the next breakthrough my wife initiated a romantic trip. It was her idea that we should drop the kids off with the grandparents and go away for the weekend. We had such a wonderful, romantic time, and rekindled our intimacy. For the next few weeks I was floating on clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you do God’s will he pours out blessings. If reconciliation wasn’t enough, my wife found a new job with no commute, making way more money, with a group of level-headed women that are really easy to work with. I believe God paved this way for her as a blessing to following through with reconciliation and delivered her from the wickedness of the old job. Now we have a new set up where we can continue to strengthen our marriage, manage the day-to-day of raising kids, and give back to the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part Four, Life is a Marathon not a Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many will hear me warn of the honeymoon period effect. The cool thing about reconciliation is that you experience a second honeymoon period.

,Marriage,"I (35M) have been with my wife (34F) for 17 years and now have come to a crossroads. Essentially, we really haven't had a healthy sex life the whole time we have been together. For most years, it was sex \~2 times per year. I have talked to her multiple times about this, but she either downplayed the importance or gave it a half ass try to improve it.  At one point, a few years ago, she had an emotionally affair with another guy, which wasn't great for me since she wouldn't be intimate with me at that point. My attraction to my wife has now dwindled down to pretty much nothing, although I have to say it wasn't probably the highest to start with. It's gotten to the point where she is actually initiating with me, but I just can't go through with it with her (my libido is still high so that's not the issue).

On the flip side, I have been withdrawing emotionally and not engaging with her as much. She said she hasn't felt special in a long time and isn't happy either due to the lack of interest by me primarily. I agree that I haven't done the best job in making her feel special.

We have been to couple's counseling two other times with not great results, but have started going again recently. We also have a 2 year old daughter and a house to complicate things.

We've talked recently about how I have felt and how I feel like a trial separation might be good for us. This would give us both some time to be more independent and reflect as well as see other people. I know that seeing other people during a separation is controversial, but I feel like it's something that I would need to get more prospective. 

She wants to stay together and work on it. I feel pretty hopeless as I am not really sure what we can do to really work on this and feel that we've had the last 15ish years to work on it and nothing has changed. I definitely have a lot of resentment for the lack of sex and feel like I have lost my 20s.

Even though I don't find her attractive, I still love my wife and she is really my best friend. We are talking openly and still get a long great even though we have some major issues. Obviously this is very difficult for me because we have a 2 year old daughter, but I thought that it wouldn't make sense and wouldn't be sustainable just to stay together for her. It's also hard because things arent BAD right now necessarily, but it's definitely not great. I guess I imagine people who get divorced should be yelling and throwing dishes at each other...

As I see it, I have 3 options:

1. Stay with her and continue to work on our issues
2. Do a trial separation to get prospective
3. Go straight to a divorce

I definitely have a lot of resentment for the lack of sex and feel like I have lost my 20s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I don&amp;#39;t find her attractive, I still love my wife and she is really my best friend. We are talking openly and still get a long great even though we have some major issues. Obviously this is very difficult for me because we have a 2 year old daughter, but I thought that it wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense and wouldn&amp;#39;t be sustainable just to stay together for her. It&amp;#39;s also hard because things arent BAD right now necessarily, but it&amp;#39;s definitely not great. I guess I imagine people who get divorced should be yelling and throwing dishes at each other...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I see it, I have 3 options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay with her and continue to work on our issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a trial separation to get prospective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go straight to a divorce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any helpful thoughts, suggestions or similar experiences would be much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"My (38F) husband (40M) and I have a difference of opinions on this, and it's become a source of recurring stress/conflict in our marriage (17 years)

I believe that, if a spouse does something that's not intentionally annoying/irritating, is not harming or impeding the other person(s) in the household, and is not making more work for others, the other spouse should just deal with it rather than complain about it.  My husband believes that these things should be brought up so that they don't fester and resentment doesn't build up.

For clarity, I'm talking about everyday stuff for which we have different opinions on what's the ""correct"" way to do things, but nobody/nothing is harmed if they are done ""incorrectly"".    For example, where to put the dishrag when you've finished washing dishes, how to mop the kitchen floor, how to fold towels, how frequently a garage door should be opened/closed, how to wash pots and pans, how to organize a kitchen cupboard, whether or not a child needs his/her hair washed at bath time, etc.  

For me, when he doesn't do something my way, I either decide I can live with it, or I fix it myself without saying anything to him.  After all, if something is important, do it yourself, and if someone else does it for you, they get to choose how they do it.  (I mean, he's said this exact thing to me, many times.  And I don't disagree.)  If I still have lingering resentment or annoyance, I figure that's my problem to deal with--that I need to be more forgiving/charitable/patient/etc.

When I'm the one who doesn't do stuff his way, he tells me.  Often I just feel mildly annoyed by his comments, I brush them off, and/or I invite him to do the thing himself the way he wants it done.  Other times, I feel really hurt (probably more hurt than is rational) and I react poorly-- I get angry, start crying, or withdraw--and then he gets further annoyed by my inability to react more appropriately/maturely.  

Put together, this puts a strain on our relationship.  Lately it's been worse than usual;  for some reason he has been more withdrawn and irritable for the past several months, and I'm feeling more vulnerable and sensitive.  It's all kind of come to a head this week.  He says he feels like he's not free to express himself because I'll react badly--and I feel like I'm not free because I feel like I'm constantly being watched/judged.  And of course, both of us think we are right and the other person is wrong:  I think he should be more tolerant, and he thinks I should be less sensitive.  Maybe we're both right, but we just don't know how to put that into practice.

,Marriage,"My wife and I have had some hard times lately, and she did something recently that I think crosses a line with me.

A few months ago, we had a wonderful day. Our child was out of the house for several hours on a Saturday. We had three glorious hours of couple time, and boy did we use them. We cooked, we drank, we had a Viagra fueled marathon session, read naked together, so many things. It really was a great day. Best day we had in months.

To commemorate it, I wrote a little note, just something to put on her desk. Something for us to smile at sometimes.

Now, we're not a perfect couple. I'd describe things as downright rocky. I've posted in /deadbedrooms more than once. But that weekend was great.

This weekend, we got into a big argument and she asked for a separation. She packed almost all her things, fine. But she also threw away a bunch of things that really hurt me. She threw away all our sex toys- all the little things I like her to wear. She tossed away a few antiques and little memorable knickknacks we purchased together over the years.

And she ripped up and threw away the little note I wrote, to commemorate that day.

She didn't just toss it in the garbage, she ripped it into little pieces. She said ""This is what out marriage is"". She actually took the pieces back out of the trash, to show me she had ripped it up.

When I finally got around to looking, I see that the only stuff she left behind was a hair dryer and a box of tampons.

We talked later that day, I bought her flowers, she bought me something too. I told her that throwing that stuff away hurt me tremendously, and she didn't have much reaction. I told her that I don't know what a separation looks like but it's a good idea and we should both take time and really think about what we want in the future.

Well this morning she texted me that she wants us to work. But I'm not sure I do.

I was actually looking forward to the time to think and reflect on how I feel about the marriage, because truthfully I don't know how I feel about it. As I said, we really are pretty rocky. I set myself a time of about three weeks to spend apart, thinking, writing, that sort of thing.

I thought I'd take the time and come to a decision and then live it, whether it be stay or go. But here she is, a day later, saying she wants to fix things.

Part of me thinks I would be a jerk to slap away her hand when she is offering an olive branch. Part of me is still hurt by her ripping up that note. Hell, be honest, a big part of me is still hurt over that.

I know she was upset at the time, and that's why she tossed that stuff. I get that. But to also destroy the thing that reminds us of this jewel of a day makes me feel so awful. Did that ""wonderful"" day mean more to me than it did to her? I've suspected so. How can she so easily destroy that memory, unless that is the case? Can her momentary anger really erase the memory of that day? Guess so.

I just feel so hurt. This wasn't a grocery list. This was, as far as I'm concerned, a love note. And she didn't just throw it away, she literally ripped it to pieces, and made sure I knew she did so. She smiled as she did it. She honestly smiled as she did it.

I feel like a really needed those few weeks to decide, and was hoping she'd take them too. Instead she's already made up her mind.

Can I really tell her that it's great that she's sure she wants to stay, but I don't have a decision yet? Isn't that pretty much guarantying a breakup reaction from her? Can I really keep her limbo for the next few weeks about something as big as our marriage?

,Marriage,"I’m writing this on mobile, sorry if there’s any formatting issues.

To start, I love my wife and she’s the best friend I could’ve asked for. We’ve been together since high school and even did long distance across a few states for a year. She is such a  beautiful woman and her personality matches. I just don’t feel like she likes me anymore, and the feeling isn’t new.

We have 2 kids (Ages 1 &amp;3. I know we’re young, they were accidents), she’s finishing up nursing school and I’m also in school, applying to medical schools in a year and a half. She’s an incredibly hard working mom and stays with the kids while I’m at school and sleeping during the weekend (I work the graveyard shift). Because we’re so busy alone time is very rare. When we do have it I’m the one trying to cuddle, kiss or have sex. She never reciprocates affection, a lot of times pulling away from kissing even when the kissing isn’t sexual. When it comes to the kids, I  take over when I’m home (and I’m happy to. My kids are the second most important thing after my wife) but no matter how much effort I put in outside of intimacy I still feel neglected.  

We’ve talked about this before and she seems genuine when she tells me she just forgets to show me love. This is why I really tried to step up in helping her, but I’m getting wore down more and more. This topic seems to come up every few months or so, with the conversation always ending with us both agreeing to work harder on our marriage. After a few months, I’m burned out from trying so hard and she says “sorry, I’ll remember to give you attention”. I feel hopeless and lonely because of how often this happens. Sometimes I begin treating her how she treats me and as soon as she doesn’t feel my “loveyness” she confronts me. After talking I usually get called dramatic or sensitive (usually in a joking way but I know she’s serious) but that’s what made us work so well!  I have a really hard time showing and opening up about my feeling because of my culture and men in my family never talked about theirs. It honestly hurts when she tells me I’m being dramatic because the fear of being called that is the whole reason I’m shut off in the first place. This cycle seems to be occurring more often and worse.

TL;DR: When I try to get my wife’s affection I get called dramatic and sensitive. 

I guess I just wonder if I’m being dramatic and how I can toughen up. Also advice on how to get her to show me more affection would be appreciated as well.

,Marriage,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm(F.26y) not really sure how all of this work since it is my first time on reddit but I need some advice. I apologize in advice for the long post and typos.

I've been married two years now (together for 3 years). Last year my husband (M.31y)admitted that when we started dating (long distance relationship) he was already in a relationship and was living with that person who also happened to be a colleague from work. At the time when we started talking I asked him if he had someone and he said no. When he told me about her last year I felt betrayed because he had been lying to me for two years at that point. So for weeks i was distant because i needed to rethink everything. Also the fact that they still work together and that he sees her everyday was hard to digest.

4 weeks ago, i found out that around that time he told me about her, him and her reconnected. She started texting him and calling him. He had to unblock her number because she told someone at work that he blocked her and that person called them immature so he felt the need to unblock her. She took that opportunity to started texting him and calling him. I checked our phones records and she texting him everyday throughout the day and was calling him multiple times a day. He was calling her back too. He deleted all texts and calls so I know all that from checking the phone records. ( He work outside while she stays in the office so he is able to use his phone all day)

He told me she would call to complain about work, gossip, talk about her professional projects, her family issues. ask him advice about people she was dating, people at work she wanted to sleep with. He said that nothing physical happened, they never see each other outside of work and barely had time to talk to each other at work. He said when he told me about her a year ago we weren't good so she was a distraction but it's spiraled out of control and became someting bigger that he wanted. He said he regrets letting it happened. It is hard for me to believe him since it lasted a whole year and he always made sure to delete everything before he comes home. He said he felt guilty for leaving her ( she doesn't know that, i didn't know either at the time) for me so he felt the need to make it up to her by being her friends and listening to her and givign her advice.  He was doing the same thing when he was with her, He was still talking to his other ex and would his her advice and listen to her etc...

This is not the only issue. I also found out that he was doing the same thing with another colleague at the same. She is older than him (40y), married with 4 kids. He started talking to her more recently (Since January). She asked him for his number and started doing the same thing his ex was doing, text, call. He also said that she was calling to talk about the people at work she has beef with, gossip about work, but she also told him about her life. He swears he wasn't trying to get with her, that he wasn't interested in her like that and she was just a distraction form our issues and just like the ex it spiraled out of control.

He said that he hoped that they would both just go away, that eventually when we have kids and he leaves for paternity leave and don't speak to them for weeks they would'nt try to talk to him when he go back etc....

The whole situation made me uncomfortable. I told him to block his ex and the colleague. He called the ex in front of me after i insisted since i didn't trust that he would do it. He did and taold her to stop texting and calling him. He also told her   the day after face to face. He refused to call his colleague and texted her instead, he din't want to call ler late at night on a Sunday ( I found out everything on a Sunday night) since she is married and i guess didn't want to get her in trouble.

I really don't know what to do. I am an overthinker so i have million of questions to ask him  but none of his responses are satisfying since i lost trust in him. I also grew up seeing my dad cheat on my mom for their entire marriage so it's hard not to feel like i'm going to be in the same situation.

Before all that we were very good and were talking about having kids, started savings for the kids etc.... But now i don't know. I still love him but I don't know if staying is the right decision. I feel like i'm too invested emotionally to make a rational decision. Also the fact that these two people are still working with him give me anxiety. i don't trust that they will not try to come back into his life. I forgot to say that he said that his colleague asked him if she could talk to me to apologize because she would'nt like if someone was talking to her husband the way she was talking to mine, she also apologize for causing issues in our household. The ex just had a petty reaction and said "" I wasn't going to call you or text you anyways"".

I don't expect you guys to make a decision for me but i need guidance.

,Marriage,"So background, husband and I have been together for 8 years and married for 5. He and I used to work and live together for the first 3 years. Then he started working out of town then out of state. Lived “separately” for 3 years because he was constantly out of state and I stayed to care for my disabled brother. So he was home for one weekend a month if that. 
Beginning of the year, I found evidence of him cheating on me with his coworker (exchanging nudes) for about a month as well as dating profiles from 2 years prior (they were created but that was it). I had a feeling that something was going on when he kept accusing me of cheating. And everyone knows that if you are being accused of something with no reasoning, they are more than likely the guilty party. So I looked through his phone and found everything. We talked and I decided to go live with him full time to try to make this work. 
So I packed up my life and moved two states away from everything and everyone. At first, living with him was great. But then I found out that he changed a lot. He started doing crack on a regular basis. He would fall asleep in his man cave a lot and stopped having sex with me. I had talked to him about him being distant with me and his drug use and he brushed it off like it was nothing. 
Then, the night before our cruise to celebrate our 5 year anniversary, I found him on multiple dating sites. This time, all 7 sites were very active. Him sending dick pics and everything. He was telling these bots (too dumb to figure out that the “women” he was talking to was fake) that he was looking for a side piece and that he wanted to spice up his sex life. Also, he was tired of his fat wife. His confidence is from him slimming down from all that crack he snorts. I gained 50 pounds since we dated but with me being 4’8” it looks like more. 
I woke his ass up because it was 2 in the morning and chewed him out. I told him afterwards that I will have a great time on the cruise because I deserve it. He didn’t look as sorry as the first time to being caught. I think he expected me to stay at this point. I mean, I stayed the first time so why should this time be different??
I told him that I would need to think about all of this and he decided that it would be a good time to put the T&amp;Cs on this marriage. Saying that I either need to leave to stay but don’t “half ass it” (when I said I needed time to think about this) and all kinds of things like that. Umm... You have NO GROUNDS to tell me how it’s going to be IF I stay with you. Dafuq???
I have been staying at my sisters for two weeks after the cruise. I spent the whole cruise ignoring him. He stayed in the room while I went out and had the time of my life. I told him that I need time to think. 
What I am really doing is finding a job (interviewing for a great at home job that pays super well) and a place at my home town. I am doing a lot of setting up and will take care of what I can for now. Then I will go home and pretend like everything is ok while I start work and hoard as much money as I can. 
I plan on leaving him within 2-6 months. I plan on focusing on me. I’m going to do whatever it takes to make me happy. I’m going to focus on my career and advancing myself. I’m going to start looking for a therapist too. 
I’m just so pissed that HE cheated multiple times and had the AUDACITY to tell me that if I hold it against him “too much” (more than a week), that he will leave me. And gets mad when I try to explain that he screwed up so he should put in the effort to fix this. So I can’t show any emotion about this at all?? 
In that moment, I realized that I don’t love him anymore. I can’t love someone who thinks like this. If I have any faults in this, it will be enabling this by going back to him the first time instead of leaving. I’m always the person who says to leave because I have been cheated on by previous partners and know how hard it is to leave but you need to respect yourself enough to let go. Before my husband, I never had anyone that was faithful to me. Well, I guess you can say WITH my STBXH. And I did leave. But being married made it different I think. It was the thought of going through a divorce that made me stay with him. I didn’t want to be the one who went through a divorce and have to start dating all over again. That and no money to start a divorce at that time. 
I feel better now that I have decided to start looking for divorce lawyers and work on me. I think that I am making the right decision. The hard part will be to act like everything is cool when I get back to that house. I just have to remember that it’s for a few months. 
Thanks for letting me rant. I don’t have any friends to talk about this with. I am just beginning to process everything and I’m so pissed that I just want to scream.

,Marriage,"There’s a lot of details that go into the background of this story, but I’ll try to summarize them.

Wife and I had been dating since we were 16. Conservative Christian upbringing. 

I had my doubts about my faith through a lot of our relationship, but it always felt like something that could resolve itself. And especially as we got closer to marriage, everything was going so well I couldn’t see how it would be a big deal and I figured I could easily be a better Christian. 

We’ve also always had communication problems, mostly on my end. I tend to clam up about things and she pays for it by feeling alone and that I’m distant.

In the last few months, with fewer distractions I’ve more come to grips with I just don’t believe in the Christian faith, and am not really sure what I believe in. She is still a believer, which I’m fine with.

As we were getting closer to possibly buying a house, I was getting nervous about this fact about myself cause I figured it would be a big deal to our relationship. This made me clam up more than normal and for a long time, knowing everyone in my life would be affected by it and this caused her feel like shit cause I would hardly tell her about my day and she felt shut out. I told her last week about what it was and she was understandably crushed. She was angry with me for lying about what I believed before we got married and felt stupid for believing me. She spent one night at her parents to deal with it, with the worry that our relationship could be over, and has returned since

She’s seen a therapist because of how crushed she feels and has asked me to do the same. 

I know I’ll see one because I know I’m pretty messed up. She still loves me and I still love her because of the history that we have.

I don’t want to cause her more pain, and even if we work through communication problems that I have, I’m afraid I may not be what she needs because of her faith.

We are going to see a marriage counselor, but I’m just afraid that it’s going to end up postponing what may happen, and I really do want her to have the best marriage, but right now I’m not sure if I’m that person because we could never really have a spiritual walk together or look for a new church together and discuss those things as a married couple.

This past February 2019) I checked her google maps on her laptop, and saw she had been visiting another city in NC two hours away from where we live. At least 6 or 7 occasions since Sept 2018. Of course I confronted her and she denied any and all wrong doing. However, after finding out her social media information she had been seeing a man she knew years ago. She finally broke down and told me the truth. She said she still loves me, water works, I don’t want to sound like I’m being insensitive of anything of her feelings but I had no signs she was having an affair. I do blame somewhat the influence of one of her best friends who got divorced because her husband did not love her anymore. 

Nevertheless, we went to counseling before due to her cheating, this was about 4 years ago. When I found out then she attempted to harm herself. I was under investigation it seemed. 

This time around I lashed out and her so many times, how could you do this to me and our family. We have three kids, she would drop them off and school and drive two hours to see him; come back and pick them up while I was working. I never unleashed so many emotions but I could not tell her to leave. I did not want divorce. I know I am an attractive man, and as an educator I am surrounded by women but not once did I think about stepping out my marriage her lies came so easy. 

I told her I wanted to stay together, work on things...she was the PERFECT wife, treated me like a supreme king but that lasted all of about a month and a half. She hardly shows affection now, and when I ask for anything sexual i feel like it’s a chore and not something she is interested In. I miss her being all over me. It is now October, and I am regretting my decision to continue the marriage. I love her truly, but I still get sick when I think about what she did; and probably still would be doing if I had not been on her laptop that day.

However, after finding out her social media information she had been seeing a man she knew years ago. She finally broke down and told me the truth. She said she still loves me, water works, I don’t want to sound like I’m being insensitive of anything of her feelings but I had no signs she was having an affair. I do blame somewhat the influence of one of her best friends who got divorced because her husband did not love her anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we went to counseling before due to her cheating, this was about 4 years ago. When I found out then she attempted to harm herself. I was under investigation it seemed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around I lashed out and her so many times, how could you do this to me and our family. We have three kids, she would drop them off and school and drive two hours to see him; come back and pick them up while I was working. I never unleashed so many emotions but I could not tell her to leave. I did not want divorce. I know I am an attractive man, and as an educator I am surrounded by women but not once did I think about stepping out my marriage her lies came so easy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her I wanted to stay together, work on things...she was the PERFECT wife, treated me like a supreme king but that lasted all of about a month and a half. She hardly shows affection now, and when I ask for anything sexual i feel like it’s a chore and not something she is interested In. I miss her being all over me. It is now October, and I am regretting my decision to continue the marriage. I love her truly, but I still get sick when I think about what she did; and probably still would be doing if I had not been on her laptop that day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our children are most important, we all deserve to be happy I forgave her; but it is being harder to forget. I don’t think I ever can but I don’t want to break her heart like she did mine. Help? Suggestion? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

Next week, I'll be in a 2 and a half years relationship and everything is going really great. We have plans to get married, plans to how our party should be, where we gonna live and those things. But despite all that, my girlfriend is still afraid of getting married and this fear is justified by one simple reason: she doesn't know a single marriage that worked. Their parents have divorced and many of the people we know have either divorced too or remain in unhealthy marriages.

But I believe happy and lasting marriages exist and I want to give her a gift in next week. It may sound silly, but I would like to gather several stories of marriages that worked and give it to her in a creative way. Then I would love to know your own stories.

It doesn't have to be stories that last decades. I also would like to hear from people who have just got married and have great expectations for the future; people who were afraid of what marriage might be, but still decided to move on; and people who have overcome hard times.

,Marriage,"So, here's some context.

I am flying with our 11 month old son (our only child at the moment)  to the east coast (we live in NV) on a last minute trip to visit my side of our family, because someone may be terminally ill. It’s at no cost to me since my relatives are paying. I am also on a paid parental leave so I'm not taking time off from work. My husband is very much into making our sons ""firsts"" a very big deal. So this would be our sons first official trip out of state and airplane ride. Now, my husband works in construction so he works when he can work. He had mentioned A WHILE BACK that he would need to give the foreman notice WAY in advance if we were to ever go on a trip. So because this trip was so last minute, I didn't invite him. I shouldn't have assumed, and I already apologized for that. As well as hurting him because I made him feel not part of the family. My husband is adamant I don't bring our son so I can spend quality time with my side of the family. My husband helped me ease into the idea by saying that he talked to the foreman and the foreman said if he needs to take the time off from work to stay home to watch our son, he can. However, I invited him and offered to pay for the ticket since i'm getting a small bonus at the end of the month as well as paid holiday pay, he would just have to take off three days from work. And since he already got approved to take the time off from the foreman at his site I don't see why he doesn't want to come. But his rebuttal was that money doesn't grow on trees and we still have financial responsibilities. I said that being gone from work for three days isn't going to change the fact that we have financial responsibilities. I told him we would be staying with family and we wouldn't need a rental car so we wouldn't have to pay for much out of pocket. He said he doesn't want to go and that I always have to be right and make him feel bad. He wants to have a ""big talk"" after I come back from my trip. But at this point, I've tried compromising with him and he's not budging. I've tried validating his feelings by trying to include him and trying to put his mind at ease about finances. I told him when I come back I'm not interested in having a discussion.

We either hash it out now or we agree to disagree and move forward. Is that realistic though-to agree to disagree about something like this?

\*Update\*

We literally keep going back and forth.

When I met her she was exiting a really bad relationship and already had 2 kids with the guy.  So I met her while she already had a 3 year old and a &lt;1 year old.  Since we've been together we have almost always been under a huge amount of stress from one event to the next.  First, it was the custody of her kids and working through issues with visitation, then it was moving in her parents while we both went back to school and got degrees.  Then getting married, then moving to a new state and starting new jobs.  Having a baby together.  Buying a house.

For the past few months she would ask me almost every night if I love her still and I say yes.

I hate myself for saying this but I don't know if I do love her.  I don't want her to leave but I feel as though it's the thought of losing a close friend that I'm feeling and not the thought of losing my lover, my soulmate, my wife.  I also I'm worried about losing my kids and family -- even her family who I have grown to love very much.  I feel so sad.  I feel awful for not loving her.  When I am hard on myself I want to scream at myself and say ""You did this, you probably didn't ever love her.  You wanted to be a hero and you helped her raise 2 kids.  It was never about her.""  Or maybe it's because you never built a real relationship with her from the start.  It was always a companion-in-arms relationship.. like two soldiers stuck in the trenches together and now the the dust is settling you don't have any relationship foundation.

About every other night during one of these exchanges she&amp;#39;ll tell me that she feels like I don&amp;#39;t love her.  I think she might be right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate myself for saying this but I don&amp;#39;t know if I do love her.  I don&amp;#39;t want her to leave but I feel as though it&amp;#39;s the thought of losing a close friend that I&amp;#39;m feeling and not the thought of losing my lover, my soulmate, my wife.  I also I&amp;#39;m worried about losing my kids and family -- even her family who I have grown to love very much.  I feel so sad.  I feel awful for not loving her.  When I am hard on myself I want to scream at myself and say &amp;quot;You did this, you probably didn&amp;#39;t ever love her.  You wanted to be a hero and you helped her raise 2 kids.  It was never about her.&amp;quot;  Or maybe it&amp;#39;s because you never built a real relationship with her from the start.  It was always a companion-in-arms relationship.. like two soldiers stuck in the trenches together and now the the dust is settling you don&amp;#39;t have any relationship foundation.  In fact, you are both older and a little out of shape and less attractive, so you can&amp;#39;t even get that feeling of crushing on each other anymore if you tried.&lt;/p&gt;

Her and I both want to have a kid. However, she wants to have a kid now. I told her it would probably better to wait till she's more active and exercising regularly because once she's pregnant it's going to be much harder to get moving. 

My wife knows how I feel and to say the least she isn't happy about it. 

I'm worried about my wife's health, mobility, and our marriage. Her mom is obese and that was a contributor to her parents divorce.

,Marriage,"I am 32 yrs old, female. Spouse is turning 30 in a couple weeks, male.

We dated 8 months b4 getting married. This year, assuming we make it makes 10 yrs.

We had a civil ceremony, an officiant in his homemade living room chapel, before rushing off to our bull crap call center jobs.

We were best friends. I thought he was who I had prayed for after a few rounds in toxic, physically, sexually and verbally abusive relationships.

He ws so different. Was so kind to his mom, and a silly, gamer, nerd but was so full of life and laughter. It was magnetic.  He seemed so confident and comfortable in who he was. I thought he was so genuine. But he was also built like a linebacker and spent in formative years growing up in the Bronx, so he had just the right amount rough around the edges that I Iiked.

I thought I had never been loved so purely, I certainly believed I could be 100% transparent with him, he felt like home.

We were so arrogant in hindsight…no premarital counseling, not telling our family. I wasn’t pregnant, we just wanted to be together and after getting it on and getting serious, we stopped getting it on in the months leading up to getting married for belief/ faith reasons and because we wanted to make sure we weren’t just caught up in the “sauce” if you will….

I remember being scared but at the same time so sure this was my one. I waited for the ring, we had no money, I just wanted to be his wife.  I didn’t care about the wedding, we could renew our vows later. Being “us’ was what mattered.

We began our lives. Had a rough 1st year. We got real jobs and he went out and bought a huge tv. I was ringless still and very saddened to see what he prioritized. We had to learn how to navigate bills and communicating etc, but we were good. minus some normal  hiccups. I tried to be the ideal wife, he still made me laugh and we had ups and downs but were happy.

One hiccup was convos with an ex who admitted to still carrying a flame, but I trusted him, and believed him when he said he just wanted to be there for her and it was nothing.

We had a baby boy. He was playing league of legends while I labored, I remember having contractions and telling him to look at the screen and he just kept playing and said “ohhh yeah” but totally ignored me. I ended up having an emergency c section… I was hoping for the moment, where he’d look at me and go “wow, your amazing, look what we made” or something, but no such moment transpired.  things changed. I felt alone. He seemed Jealous, of our kid…and like  and angry all the time. I was nursing and in school and felt I had no help. He always said from what I read that is the mom’s time. I don’t want to  do anything wrong. Or would say I didn’t trust him so he would stay back. the burn out set in, but I still wanted him. I wanted our family. I figured if I was a better mom or wife it wouldn’t be so hard and pressed on.

I struggle with depression. I was in a shit claims adjuster role stressed to the max. we would later learn that our toddler had autism.  Again I felt alone in dealing with this.

He withdrew and I focused on our son. I think I just assumed it was normal. I never questioned the growing distance between us. I would try to over compensate when he started to distance him self. I would shower him with attention and “grown up time” trying to will him back in love. Sometimes it stuck but not really. Then I learned he had never cut ties with her. Spells of talking to her and deleting messages. I said they were flirty, he said it was nothing. It was because  she was depressed and he needs a friend who knows him. He said he lost everyone for me. He went to an interesting church when we met. And I recently learned his mom basically excommunicated him for dating me. They thought I was “an unsaved hussy” and was tainting his life with lust. They asserted he was doing wrong by moving out and leaving his mom to pay bills alone…..so much more that could go here but not the focus.

When our son was 3 three we were fresh off of buying a house (that we could barely afford and should have not purchased) and our son’s diagnosis. He blamed me for him not getting on the fire department and thought I would be happy after we got he house, so the fact that I still was struggling with depression made him feel less of a man.

I struggled with work, mom life and school. My depression skyrocketed. I felt alone, like a maid, not heard or seen. My family and friends were always doing stuff with their husband, I started wondering if I was defective, too fat or ugly. Why doesn’t the man I love enjoy me? Why does he not want to do family stuff, or take me out. Why does he scowl at me, look right thru me….i mean expert level stonewalling. Like inches from him talking to him and he refuses to acknowledge me. He would say I am a great mom, the best even, but a shit wife. He wanted attention, more than I gave him. He said he deserved better and could not commit to forever. It was like a carrot dangled…I will try to to love you or stay but no guarantees. It was a cycle. Weeks of okay-ness sprinkled with good days and intense lovemaking…then weeks or months of hatred and contempt towards me spewing out of his pores. He gained weight and was always sleeping. I thought he was depressed too but he never accepted that, just blamed me for not making him feel good. said I used to love him enough to make him forget he hated himself. I guess I lost my value when that stopped. He said he expects a loving wife to anticipate his needs, that he’d sit and watch and see if I’d hang myself….if I didn’t pass the test of whatever he was hoping I’d do, cue the silent treatment. I just internalized . I would get guilty for being spread too thin, and jump thru hoops to win back his grace, every time.

I didn’t know where it came from or when it would resurge.  After a while I spiraled out.

I had a breakdown, not just the relationship just everything. Work shame and blame I had on myself about my son’s autism, feeling unloved, a toxic job, panic and anxiety, maybe some ptsd from the relationships before. I crumbled. But I never wanted to die, or planned to kill myself, but I knew the depression was escalating, I was purging and cutting, not sleeping and felt paranoid. He did try to be supportive, always said though if he was enough of a man or enough for me I’d be happy. He resent my depression. He lost weight and He got into fitness heavy and resented I didn’t match his 2 hr a day regimen. He was doing it to because a fireman. Failed the test around the time of my breakdown, where I was hospitalized.

It was soo weird. I got out and he said everything I wanted to hear. That he loved me and he will do better to help and I am not alone and he was proud I asked for help. I told him not to blame himself, the depression wasn’t his fault and he never believed me. Days later it was like a switch.

The hate eyes were back. the stonewalling. It was like I was a bag of filth walking thru his crystal palace and he couldn’t tolerate my stench. That is as best I can describe the looks he’d give, the curled lip snarls etc. it was hell.  I started doubting everything. But I was in therapy I was learning why and how to deal with my depression and anxiety.

I got a less stressful job but he was checked out. He was talking to the ex regularly. We’d fight about it over and over, thru the years and he accused me most recently of wanting her to die. He would make excuses about her mental health or say just friends.

But recently he said she gets him and there is nothing between us. He literally said he feels nothing between us. We are parenting partners only, there is no companionship. He was turned off that I wouldn’t gym with him because he is doing it for our son and the fact that I wont makes him mad because I have pcos and likely cant get pregnant again if I do not first lose weight.

It was never enough to work out, we had to watch hours of YouTube about exercise and keto. And then his fave anime, all while I primarily do for our kid, manage a new job and get my MBA, and I started a business.

It was never enough he still acted disgusted by me. I finally called him on the text with her as of late. Seemed like the flirtation was escalating to discussing hanging out. He called her  the “dopest” chick he knew, was down talking me and my family and sending her romantic music suggestions.

He would never talk to me but told her all types of personal stuff.

We fought. He said he is moving out. First I was pissed then I agreed . but since attending therapy he and asking about it he doesn’t see the need to.

On one hand  I see that while he never hit me, he was still sort of  emotionally abusive. The stonewalling, the saying “he had to be mean and manipulative to get my attention” it was toxic…I am not saying there are not ways I could be a better wife. I  know it takes too, attention and sex matter, but I feel he never took accountability for how his emotional affair and disrespectful treatment  affected our bond.

Now I look back and realize how dumb it is to marry that young, and to someone after just 8 months.

I see things were kind of emotionally manipulative.

I see my codependency and that he has some traits that I honestly don’t know r just immaturity or bpd or narcissistic traits…idk

Its hard because  it isn’t all bad. There are moments where there is so much good and he has been there but I am wondering if he every really loved me the way a man should.

I do not know where his faith stands anymore, I do not know if he loves his ex. I don’t know if I should even care.

I hate the limbo of it all. If u don’t think I’m it, then go, like now, get out.

Maybe a break will be good, we are going to therapy. He claims to be committed and says he cut her off…I dk I trust that also this only was instigated because our latest fight about her happened in front of family. So now his mom knows he has been carrying on like that. He ulled a 180 and cut the grass, lost the stonewalling ice stare and started making small talk since then…..which is even more crazy making!?!

I do not know how to exist in the house with him. How do you live with the cloud of “maybe” or someone’s indifference to you in the face of all your unconditional love even after they crap all over you.

I know he doesn’t respect me…why would he, I have bent and caved and accepted fault to please his ego for 10 yrs.

I kind of want him out so I can breath. And so he can see what its really like. Maybe he will realize he took me for granted. Or maybe its just over. Can it still work out? Is this the reality check and reset we needed or is it curtains??

Also for context, his gripe with me is: not enough sex, attention, and not making him “feel loved” I asked for example or what will make him feel that way and get “idk like a relationship?!” or that it “should go without saying”, that “the one for him would know how to anticipate his needs” and just think of him and show it everyday and he says I am not that thoughtful and am cold.…..sigh

How do you guys cope with the ever swinging pendulum of emotion??? Up, down, please stay, GTFOH…I feel like I am loosing my shit?

I am wondering if I just need to ignore him, continue therapy and focus on my son and school. Not pay him any mind…but easier said than done.

Tl; dr: 10 years, married young, have a kiddo with autism, husband had emotional affair, codependent/ narcissist dynamics (do you agree?) ….is he just immature and should I  see how therapy goes? I don’t know how to be in the house with him and we can’t afford to not live together? How to cope with tension, or awkwardness and rollercoaster of it all? I admittedly am scared as f of being alone…but I’m starting to get more scared to live like this, losing and betraying myself and showing my son a coward of a woman, when I know deep down I have purpose and when I am not up his as, I get closer to the me I want to  grow into….but I also still love the guy…

Spouse is turning 30 in a couple weeks, male.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dated 8 months b4 getting married. This year, assuming we make it makes 10 yrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a civil ceremony, an officiant in his homemade living room chapel, before rushing off to our bull crap call center jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were best friends. I thought he was who I had prayed for after a few rounds in toxic, physically, sexually and verbally abusive relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ws so different. Was so kind to his mom, and a silly, gamer, nerd but was so full of life and laughter. It was magnetic.  He seemed so confident and comfortable in who he was. I thought he was so genuine. But he was also built like a linebacker and spent in formative years growing up in the Bronx, so he had just the right amount rough around the edges that I Iiked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I had never been loved so purely, I certainly believed I could be 100% transparent with him, he felt like home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were so arrogant in hindsight…no premarital counseling, not telling our family. I wasn’t pregnant, we just wanted to be together and after getting it on and getting serious, we stopped getting it on in the months leading up to getting married for belief/ faith reasons and because we wanted to make sure we weren’t just caught up in the “sauce” if you will….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember being scared but at the same time so sure this was my one. I waited for the ring, we had no money, I just wanted to be his wife.  I didn’t care about the wedding, we could renew our vows later. Being “us’ was what mattered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began our lives. Had a rough 1st year. We got real jobs and he went out and bought a huge tv. I was ringless still and very saddened to see what he prioritized. We had to learn how to navigate bills and communicating etc, but we were good. minus some normal  hiccups. I tried to be the ideal wife, he still made me laugh and we had ups and downs but were happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hiccup was convos with an ex who admitted to still carrying a flame, but I trusted him, and believed him when he said he just wanted to be there for her and it was nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a baby boy. He was playing league of legends while I labored, I remember having contractions and telling him to look at the screen and he just kept playing and said “ohhh yeah” but totally ignored me. I ended up having an emergency c section… I was hoping for the moment, where he’d look at me and go “wow, your amazing, look what we made” or something, but no such moment transpired.  things changed. I felt alone. He seemed Jealous, of our kid…and like  and angry all the time. I was nursing and in school and felt I had no help. He always said from what I read that is the mom’s time. I don’t want to  do anything wrong. Or would say I didn’t trust him so he would stay back. the burn out set in, but I still wanted him. I wanted our family. I figured if I was a better mom or wife it wouldn’t be so hard and pressed on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggle with depression. I was in a shit claims adjuster role stressed to the max. we would later learn that our toddler had autism.  Again I felt alone in dealing with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He withdrew and I focused on our son. I think I just assumed it was normal. I never questioned the growing distance between us. I would try to over compensate when he started to distance him self. I would shower him with attention and “grown up time” trying to will him back in love. Sometimes it stuck but not really. Then I learned he had never cut ties with her. Spells of talking to her and deleting messages. I said they were flirty, he said it was nothing. It was because  she was depressed and he needs a friend who knows him. He said he lost everyone for me. He went to an interesting church when we met. And I recently learned his mom basically excommunicated him for dating me. They thought I was “an unsaved hussy” and was tainting his life with lust. They asserted he was doing wrong by moving out and leaving his mom to pay bills alone…..so much more that could go here but not the focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When our son was 3 three we were fresh off of buying a house (that we could barely afford and should have not purchased) and our son’s diagnosis. He blamed me for him not getting on the fire department and thought I would be happy after we got he house, so the fact that I still was struggling with depression made him feel less of a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggled with work, mom life and school. My depression skyrocketed. I felt alone, like a maid, not heard or seen. My family and friends were always doing stuff with their husband, I started wondering if I was defective, too fat or ugly. Why doesn’t the man I love enjoy me? Why does he not want to do family stuff, or take me out. Why does he scowl at me, look right thru me….i mean expert level stonewalling. Like inches from him talking to him and he refuses to acknowledge me. He would say I am a great mom, the best even, but a shit wife. He wanted attention, more than I gave him. He said he deserved better and could not commit to forever. It was like a carrot dangled…I will try to to love you or stay but no guarantees. It was a cycle. Weeks of okay-ness sprinkled with good days and intense lovemaking…then weeks or months of hatred and contempt towards me spewing out of his pores. He gained weight and was always sleeping. I thought he was depressed too but he never accepted that, just blamed me for not making him feel good. said I used to love him enough to make him forget he hated himself. I guess I lost my value when that stopped. He said he expects a loving wife to anticipate his needs, that he’d sit and watch and see if I’d hang myself….if I didn’t pass the test of whatever he was hoping I’d do, cue the silent treatment. I just internalized . I would get guilty for being spread too thin, and jump thru hoops to win back his grace, every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know where it came from or when it would resurge.  After a while I spiraled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a breakdown, not just the relationship just everything. Work shame and blame I had on myself about my son’s autism, feeling unloved, a toxic job, panic and anxiety, maybe some ptsd from the relationships before. I crumbled. But I never wanted to die, or planned to kill myself, but I knew the depression was escalating, I was purging and cutting, not sleeping and felt paranoid. He did try to be supportive, always said though if he was enough of a man or enough for me I’d be happy. He resent my depression. He lost weight and He got into fitness heavy and resented I didn’t match his 2 hr a day regimen. He was doing it to because a fireman. Failed the test around the time of my breakdown, where I was hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was soo weird. I got out and he said everything I wanted to hear. That he loved me and he will do better to help and I am not alone and he was proud I asked for help. I told him not to blame himself, the depression wasn’t his fault and he never believed me. Days later it was like a switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hate eyes were back. the stonewalling. It was like I was a bag of filth walking thru his crystal palace and he couldn’t tolerate my stench. That is as best I can describe the looks he’d give, the curled lip snarls etc. it was hell.  I started doubting everything. But I was in therapy I was learning why and how to deal with my depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a less stressful job but he was checked out. He was talking to the ex regularly. We’d fight about it over and over, thru the years and he accused me most recently of wanting her to die. He would make excuses about her mental health or say just friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But recently he said she gets him and there is nothing between us. He literally said he feels nothing between us. We are parenting partners only, there is no companionship. He was turned off that I wouldn’t gym with him because he is doing it for our son and the fact that I wont makes him mad because I have pcos and likely cant get pregnant again if I do not first lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was never enough to work out, we had to watch hours of YouTube about exercise and keto. And then his fave anime, all while I primarily do for our kid, manage a new job and get my MBA, and I started a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was never enough he still acted disgusted by me. I finally called him on the text with her as of late. Seemed like the flirtation was escalating to discussing hanging out. He called her  the “dopest” chick he knew, was down talking me and my family and sending her romantic music suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would never talk to me but told her all types of personal stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fought. He said he is moving out. First I was pissed then I agreed . but since attending therapy he and asking about it he doesn’t see the need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand  I see that while he never hit me, he was still sort of  emotionally abusive. The stonewalling, the saying “he had to be mean and manipulative to get my attention” it was toxic…I am not saying there are not ways I could be a better wife. I  know it takes too, attention and sex matter, but I feel he never took accountability for how his emotional affair and disrespectful treatment  affected our bond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I look back and realize how dumb it is to marry that young, and to someone after just 8 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see things were kind of emotionally manipulative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see my codependency and that he has some traits that I honestly don’t know r just immaturity or bpd or narcissistic traits…idk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its hard because  it isn’t all bad. There are moments where there is so much good and he has been there but I am wondering if he every really loved me the way a man should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know where his faith stands anymore, I do not know if he loves his ex. I don’t know if I should even care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate the limbo of it all. If u don’t think I’m it, then go, like now, get out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe a break will be good, we are going to therapy. He claims to be committed and says he cut her off…I dk I trust that also this only was instigated because our latest fight about her happened in front of family. So now his mom knows he has been carrying on like that. He ulled a 180 and cut the grass, lost the stonewalling ice stare and started making small talk since then…..which is even more crazy making!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know how to exist in the house with him. How do you live with the cloud of “maybe” or someone’s indifference to you in the face of all your unconditional love even after they crap all over you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know he doesn’t respect me…why would he, I have bent and caved and accepted fault to please his ego for 10 yrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kind of want him out so I can breath. And so he can see what its really like. Maybe he will realize he took me for granted. Or maybe its just over. Can it still work out? Is this the reality check and reset we needed or is it curtains??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also for context, his gripe with me is: not enough sex, attention, and not making him “feel loved” I asked for example or what will make him feel that way and get “idk like a relationship?!” or that it “should go without saying”, that “the one for him would know how to anticipate his needs” and just think of him and show it everyday and he says I am not that thoughtful and am cold.…..sigh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you guys cope with the ever swinging pendulum of emotion??? Up, down, please stay, GTFOH…I feel like I am loosing my shit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering if I just need to ignore him, continue therapy and focus on my son and school. Not pay him any mind…but easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl; dr: 10 years, married young, have a kiddo with autism, husband had emotional affair, codependent/ narcissist dynamics (do you agree?) ….is he just immature and should I  see how therapy goes? I don’t know how to be in the house with him and we can’t afford to not live together? How to cope with tension, or awkwardness and rollercoaster of it all? I admittedly am scared as f of being alone…but I’m starting to get more scared to live like this, losing and betraying myself and showing my son a coward of a woman, when I know deep down I have purpose and when I am not up his as, I get closer to the me I want to  grow into….but I also still love the guy…&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Long story short our argument about something small escalated into me telling him how I felt he wasn’t contributing, supporting me, etc. He told me I was a horrible wife etc. It ended up with him saying we need to get divorced. I simply told him if that’s what he wanted then so be it. 

Well a few minutes later I saw his phone and it showed that he searched and found a gun store nearby. 

I confronted him and he said it was just an impulsive search. I was still freaking out so I called some crisis lines and they recommended I go to emergency services to have him evaluated. He agreed. So we went.

What ended up happening is that we spent 8+ hours in the ER, being interviewed by various folks including a doctor who said he needed to be sent overnight to a psychiatric ward and assessed there. They didn’t give a choice, so he said he’d go voluntarily. I repeatedly told them I didn’t know if that was a good idea especially because he has a chronic illness and a ton of medications and treatments he needs to do. They weren’t budging. They told me that he could be a danger to himself and me.

The next morning after spending a night in a psych ward, he was assessed by the psychiatric nurse practitioner. They recommended him for discharge. They talked to me as well and said that he needs to go to consistent therapy (he hasn’t) and continue his depression medication. But they said that he was stable and clearly functioning and shouldn’t have been there overnight. It was a horrible place with people screaming obscenities and all kinds of stuff.

When he was getting registered there the night before I asked if they had all his medications. They didn’t. I was so upset I started crying and demanded they get his meds and told that this was a mess and he shouldn’t be there. They immediately started getting in order but that’s another way I tried to fight for him. 

Since he’s gotten discharged he’s made it a point to constantly tell me that I put him in a mental hospital and blaming me for the debacle. He missed a few work emails and he said he might get fired from his job because of me. Even though he emailed them and let them know he was going to be out sick. He has demanded I apologize for putting him in a mental hospital. Except I feel like I did the right thing? I’m so upset because it seems like this is going to ruin our marriage. I didn’t want to risk his life and was shocked he searched for a gun store. I didn’t know if I could trust he was ok. But he thinks I unnecessarily freaked out and had anxiety.

I simply told him if that’s what he wanted then so be it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well a few minutes later I saw his phone and it showed that he searched and found a gun store nearby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I confronted him and he said it was just an impulsive search. I was still freaking out so I called some crisis lines and they recommended I go to emergency services to have him evaluated. He agreed. So we went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What ended up happening is that we spent 8+ hours in the ER, being interviewed by various folks including a doctor who said he needed to be sent overnight to a psychiatric ward and assessed there. They didn’t give a choice, so he said he’d go voluntarily. I repeatedly told them I didn’t know if that was a good idea especially because he has a chronic illness and a ton of medications and treatments he needs to do. They weren’t budging. They told me that he could be a danger to himself and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning after spending a night in a psych ward, he was assessed by the psychiatric nurse practitioner. They recommended him for discharge. They talked to me as well and said that he needs to go to consistent therapy (he hasn’t) and continue his depression medication. But they said that he was stable and clearly functioning and shouldn’t have been there overnight. It was a horrible place with people screaming obscenities and all kinds of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he was getting registered there the night before I asked if they had all his medications. They didn’t. I was so upset I started crying and demanded they get his meds and told that this was a mess and he shouldn’t be there. They immediately started getting in order but that’s another way I tried to fight for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since he’s gotten discharged he’s made it a point to constantly tell me that I put him in a mental hospital and blaming me for the debacle. He missed a few work emails and he said he might get fired from his job because of me. Even though he emailed them and let them know he was going to be out sick. He has demanded I apologize for putting him in a mental hospital. Except I feel like I did the right thing? I’m so upset because it seems like this is going to ruin our marriage. I didn’t want to risk his life and was shocked he searched for a gun store. I didn’t know if I could trust he was ok. But he thinks I unnecessarily freaked out and had anxiety. At the end of the day I didn’t even have a say in what happened once we go to the hospital, and frankly didn’t think they’d go that route.. and once there tried to advocate for him. &lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"I (F 24) am recently married, approx. 6 months in. We dated for approximately 2 years and had a longer engagement, 1.5 years roughly. My S/O (M 29) and I had discussed children prior to marriage, that we both want them eventually but he wants them sooner since he is older.

I would like them eventually but this could be when I'm 30.. 35.. or older with medical advances. He would like to have children in the next 2-3 years and we have argued/fought about this a few times. 

In response, I have been meeting with a therapist just to sort out my feelings on it. The therapist was more concerned about other relationship issues I was telling her about and the sessions quickly became identifying his controlling behaviors and verbal aggression at times. I have gained a lot of insight on this and because things are early on, the therapist does have hope for us if he is willing to learn skills and make some changes. I have invited him to sessions but he believes that our issues should stay within ourselves and that therapists are similar to car mechanics- they tell you something is wrong so you keep coming back (huge red flag that I am now acknowledging). He has other good qualities and we enjoy each other's company so not every time is bad. This whole situation has been affecting me emotionally/physically- difficulty sleeping, lack of productivity, mental anguish about what to do.

Last night we fought again about it and I told him that I feel like I am preventing the inevitable, that I won't just wake up one day and suddenly want children just because he wants them. He then responded that because he wants them, that I should be able to meet him half way because we are in a marriage together and that is what you do for one another. I completely disagree and feel that the reasoning he is giving is more for doing things that are slightly inconvenient like visiting in-laws or going to their favorite concert that you hate, etc.

,Marriage,"My wife and I have been married for between 1 and 2 years, and to simplify a complex story, after suspecting for some time, she looked for and found pornography on my computer that I had lied about. I'm well aware that for some couples the use of pornography isn't a problem, but for us it was, and the lie even more so. 

This was almost a year ago. Since that time, I've cleaned up completely and am proud to say I've been porn-free and, with increasing comfort, free of wandering eyes since what in recovery communities is called ""D-Day,"" the discovery day which is invariably shocking and traumatic to the betrayed spouse -- my wife.

What needs to be clear is that to those who are hurt, this kind of material isn't harmless fantasy. It's genuine trauma, someone implicitly saying that they're not enough, because you went to something else for fulfillment of sexual desire.

It's like an attack, abuse, and betrayal. With that trauma comes PTSD in a very genuine sense of the term, with flashbacks / re-living of trauma, hypervigilance, suspicion, and pain.

We've been trying to work through this but I can't seem to help her. We've been forced by work to be geographically apart and see each other at best once a month, so we can't realistically go to counseling. She's threatened divorce on so many occasions, especially when we're apart, but seems to usually feel somewhat better, and sometimes drastically better, when we're together. It's just rare that we can be.

To head off any such comments before they start, please don't tell me to just get a divorce, don't tell me it's a losing battle. I'm not in denial about this: from all the reading I've done (and it's been a lot), healing is absolutely possible and it takes usually 2-3 years to get back to something that resembles a functional relationship again. I can be as patient as I need to be, and I'm not going anywhere, and I'm not getting discouraged. I just want to help her be happier by showing her however I can, with the limits of our geography, that I value her for every bit of the amazing woman she is, that there's nothing I'd change about her, and that there's no one else I want. But she cuts me out and cuts off communication so often, I think because talking to me reminds her of the trauma and forces her to relive it, and she's stressed out enough as it is without that stabbing away in her mind.

To anyone who's fought through similar trauma with their own partner and come out still together and hopefully even been happy together again, I would appreciate any words of advice you could offer.

Thank you.

,Marriage,"My husband had an apprenticeship at work to become an electrical engineer. He ended up losing it due to the gm strike and the factory downsizing for lack of sales. It is not certain if he will ever get it back. They paid for 2 semesters of school, but will not pay for anymore now that his apprenticeship is over. He says he wants to quit his job after he finishes up his last semester in a few months so he can just go to school full time.

He says he would rather work at fast food part time because he says at least they will work with his school schedule, where his factory job will not unless they are paying for it. That would be a drastic paycut for him, with the additional burden of a student loan. He says he is going to apply for student aid, but I'm not sure how much he would actually receive.


He says another option would be having me be the sole provider for 2 years while he enrolls in school.

,Marriage,"I'm posting here because I love how people on this forum try to understand both sides of the relationship.

We're in a long distance relationship (closing the distance in 1 year). We spend a lot of time on Skype when we're not at work, just having each other in the background, not necessarily talking. Just to know that we're there. Sometimes we'd both go and do other things while Skype is on (even shopping). I'm an academic type of person, I like talking about things very much in depth. The rest of my family are like that too, they're always up for 2 hour chats if they have the time.

My fiance, on the other hand, has ADHD and finds it very hard to concentrate. He's a wonderful person and tries his best to give me the attention I need. I told him that sending me occasional cute texts would help, and he's been doing that which has really been helping with the distance.

But sometimes, when I try to talk to him, he literally cuts me mid-sentence to tell me that it's too much and he can't concentrate on it. I try to respect that, but going long periods of time when I know neither of us are busy and can talk (but are still on Skype), I feel like he hates talking to me and I worry we'll just be in a relationship like this when we're together (both sitting in the same room but not interacting).

We visit each other every few months for weeks at a time. We have fun together, but when we get used to each other we do just have a standard life where we're together at home, and interaction is limited to ""want something to eat/drink"" or other small statements like that every half an hour. Even if I'm busy working on my computer, I find it hard to have such limited conversations with him when we're in the same room.

This morning, I watched a youtube video about thing to do/not to do in a marriage and I wanted to share them with him because I thought we both did some things right and some things wrong. He started listening, but after 5 minutes he said ""listen, I thought this was going to be a conversation, not you just talking for 10 minutes. I don't have the mental capacity to listen to this right now.""

I felt so disappointed I just started crying. And by crying, I mean sobbing. I think part of it is the distance and me feeling lonely, but I really don't know why my emotional reaction was so strong this time. I didn't blame him for feeling the way that he did, but I just felt an overwhelming sense of disappointment.

,Marriage,"My wife and I have been married for almost two years. She suffers from BPD and depression and I suffer from depression and anxiety and a little PTSD from the things that happened during deployment. She constantly starts fights and is always in a rage over the smallest things. She doesn’t contribute financially or as emotionally as she thinks she does and it kills me. I love this woman to death and personality wise, I’m a giver from what my both of my therapist say. I’ve started seeing two separate therapists so that I can get perspective on if I’m doing what’s right in the marriage. And they both agree that there are many ways that I can improve however, the toxic nature of this relationship with her BPD makes it almost impossible for me to emotionally recover from the emotional trauma she put me through in the beginning of the relationship to now.  No infidelity at all, no thoughts. We both love eachother greatly but I feel she won’t do anything for herself or start her career or provide anything unless we legally separate and I go to school where I plan in the next few months and she goes home (were we will end up after my school together) and starts her business and education away from the distractions of the fighting of the relationship. I also feel thst it will be a way for her to get consistent therapy in a familiar environment without having to get yet another therapist where I’m going to school, then change to one at our final place of residence.

,Marriage,"I could so use your input. We have been together for 12 years and have 2 autistic children. I knew my husband was quirky. I didn't realize it was autism until I was pregnant a second time and saw the symptoms in my older child. From there it was just down, down, down. My husband's symptoms became a lot worse with the stress of kids. 

For years I've told him that we need therapy. It doesn't help that we have very little support network. Most of my family is dead or estranged, he has no friends and is very distant from his family. 

He tells me we can't get a baby-sitter (my sibling probably could once or twice a month). He tells me we don't have the money (we do). He tells me we just need to spend time together - we do, but obviously it's more than that. 

I don't think either of us cares to spend time together. My hobbies, interests, what happened in my day are of no interest to him. To be blunt, his doesn't appeal to me either. I at least try to engage him ; if what I'm talking about doesn't interest him, he'll be sure to tell me it's dumb, talk over me, scoff about it, ignore me or revert back to talking about himself. 

He talks a lot about a female coworker he says has been in a relationship for years. I know he has a crush. And to be honest... It doesn't bother me. I guess it should.

I don't know what else to do. He has ignored me regarding the seriousness of this for years. Now we are truly roommates and strangers. 

Ultimately I don't think divorce is an option for us - as our kids will likely need lifelong care, and the cost of raising those funds if we separate will be hard. I don't know when I will be able to return to the workforce and if I could make a go of supporting us alone... Because I would need to be off for Summers, holidays, and likely the frequent and inevitable times the school sends my kids home..I can't imagine having anything other than minimum wage jobs. I always just figured my income would get funneled directly to our retirement and trusts for the kids. 

Last week was our anniversary, which I mentioned casually. I didn't expect anything - that ship for us sailed a long time ago. He joked about how we made it that long. Inertia, I said. We both laughed. In the way that two people who know they are together because they have no other choice laugh.

Here’s my brag list

*  she still insists on a front bench vehicle, so she could sit closer 


*  sex life is still frequent, varied and we still talk about what we liked or didn’t 


*  survived 20 years of military life and all the deployments/ time apart


*  sailed a boat together (just us) 2200 miles over 4 months,  this requires a lot of 

teamwork and living closely. It was awesome so we plan to do more.


*  we have been full time renovating an old farmhouse the last few months.  Again this requires working together, not just coexistence.

My tips for marriage.

1)  talk, things don’t magically resolve themselves so don’t keep shit bottled up between you and your spouse.

2)  your spouse is your life partner so he/she comes first.  Yes before your bros, and even your children your spouse comes first.  

3) **will this matter in a year? 10 years?**  There will be disagreements that cant be resolved with a compromise so ask yourself this  question.  If the answer is no then let it go.



Thats it. I wish everyone happiness.

,Marriage,"So I’ll try and make this brief. I jumped into marriage with someone I did not know fully. We got married after 3 weeks. After the paperwork was done, things began to unravel. 

1. I began to find out prior sickness, citizenship and certain baggage I didn’t give myself time to see through a proper dating phase. Now a lot of these thugs I felt like should have been brought up, but weren’t. I became extremely nervous of the citizenship, but she was already getting it without our marriage so I calmed. 

2. The outburst, I was very open and honest about my past and life story; but she became verbally abusive and used my past against me every chance she could and would use my pain against me constantly. We’ve been married for about 2 years and it just stopped maybe 2 1/2 months ago. She would constantly try and shame me and break me it seemed, she would try to dominate me it was extremely strange the methods she would try using. Even sexual, she would say you just have a big penis, but it hurts so your sex is horrible. I mean it seemed like everything was a problem. She complained about me going to the gym, my friends and etc. I felt she was trying to control me and isolate me in a sense. 

3. Her family hates my background and my ethnicity, yes racist comments have been said, since they wouldn’t talk to her; she would lash at me and not talk to me for days, literally days and would say it’s my punishment or I needed to learn my lesson “lol”

4. I could never express myself, If I felt bothered and tried to talk about anything i would get screamed at and have it turned back on myself, lasted until as of 3 weeks ago. I felt so silenced. 

5.  I could never disagree with her, her way or the highway. 

6. She literally walks around so sad all the time, she won’t ever open up and she just tells me she hates her life and I ruined it and etc. 

7. She is extremely childish and lacks maturity when it comes to addressing issues and getting to the roots of things and just dealing with one’s issues. When I try and talk to her she says you just get to deep and gets pissed, if I try small talk her attention span or interest isn’t there. It’s annoying af. 

8. There’s plenty of issues and therapist have even suggested to get out of town jack. Our marriage counselor has told her change or he will leave and you shouldn’t be surprised. 

Now briefly about me, 

I was not a very nice guy prior to her, I had many one night relationships and come from a background where males are overly domineering and controlling. I knew I didn’t want to be that way so with my wife I made it a choice to be a better man. Respectful, thoughtful, kind and patient, I was open and consistent, she shit on me for an entire year and 6months and now I’m fed up! She has gotten me to a place where I’m emotionally shut off and turned off by her in every way, when I’m away from her I feel good, I’ve began to build myself back to my standards and I’m ready to pack up and go. 

I have asked her for divorce and now she wants to play victim and be all nice for a couple of days and I’m supposed to just say all is well. I don’t think that is fair and she abused and under appreciated me for so long I just don’t see us getting back on track. 

I am a man that cooked, cleaned and took care of everything, she didn’t start cleaning until after a year or cooking. It was annoying af. 

I’m not perfect, but if you heard the story with both of us I’d be willing to bet you’d ask why the hell you stay so long. 

The kicker: we have a wonderful child and I love my kid, but I also feel like I shouldn’t have to stay for our baby. 

This situation is very toxic &amp; draining and I deep down don’t feel like I love her. Guys hit on her and I could care less, hell if she went on a date now I wouldn’t mind. To me that is extremely bad. 

I am not satisfied in any way, truthfully. It’s sad I have to imaging other things to get me to a place of goodness and I feel guilty about it after, to me it’s so stressful. 

Honestly I know I want to get the hell out of this relationship, she recently got mad at me because I’ve preparing for this new position and I just needed her to be patient while I accomplished everything and she spazzes that I’m to busy, like damn an extra $35,000 salary increase for our family... sacrifice 2 weeks for a long term goal. She said “it feels like you’re not here, one I don’t want to be here and two there are worst things to complain about I feel.” Why not see my lack of sleep and efforts, hell I still cooked dinner some days and made sure everything was in order. Like damn you’ll be fine. I even would walk in and try and talk and she would be dry as an Arizona dessert. Hell she could have gotten up also and sought after me, I have and would have.

I knew I didn’t want to be that way so with my wife I made it a choice to be a better man. Respectful, thoughtful, kind and patient, I was open and consistent, she shit on me for an entire year and 6months and now I’m fed up! She has gotten me to a place where I’m emotionally shut off and turned off by her in every way, when I’m away from her I feel good, I’ve began to build myself back to my standards and I’m ready to pack up and go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have asked her for divorce and now she wants to play victim and be all nice for a couple of days and I’m supposed to just say all is well. I don’t think that is fair and she abused and under appreciated me for so long I just don’t see us getting back on track. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a man that cooked, cleaned and took care of everything, she didn’t start cleaning until after a year or cooking. It was annoying af. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not perfect, but if you heard the story with both of us I’d be willing to bet you’d ask why the hell you stay so long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kicker: we have a wonderful child and I love my kid, but I also feel like I shouldn’t have to stay for our baby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation is very toxic &amp;amp; draining and I deep down don’t feel like I love her. Guys hit on her and I could care less, hell if she went on a date now I wouldn’t mind. To me that is extremely bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not satisfied in any way, truthfully. It’s sad I have to imaging other things to get me to a place of goodness and I feel guilty about it after, to me it’s so stressful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly I know I want to get the hell out of this relationship, she recently got mad at me because I’ve preparing for this new position and I just needed her to be patient while I accomplished everything and she spazzes that I’m to busy, like damn an extra $35,000 salary increase for our family... sacrifice 2 weeks for a long term goal. She said “it feels like you’re not here, one I don’t want to be here and two there are worst things to complain about I feel.” Why not see my lack of sleep and efforts, hell I still cooked dinner some days and made sure everything was in order. Like damn you’ll be fine. I even would walk in and try and talk and she would be dry as an Arizona dessert. Hell she could have gotten up also and sought after me, I have and would have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, excuse my ending frustration. I just wanted to see some thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;

Ive been thinking about how we might be able to fix things. A big issue was communication and the way I contributed to that was being easily frustrated and losing my temper at times. It has always been clear to me where this stemmed from as I am normally a very relaxed and laid back guy, and it was a deep longing for physical affection and growing resentment that I had to live not entirely, but largely without it.

She was the classic “gifts and acts of service”, myself physical touch almost entirely and a little bit of words of affection. I got very very little of either but it was only the former that I desperately wanted.

Is it actually possible for someone to change their love language so that it’s not forced and they can actually share in the enjoyment of physical touch?

Also, can someone who doesn’t have physical touch as a love language explain to me how it feels when your partner wants to hug and kiss and stroke you? Is it annoying?

He can go on and on, and on and on, about any subject that he cares about. It’s usually music, sports, or his school work (went back to college a year ago). I always want to make him feel heard and appreciated, so I always try to be an active listener and respond to his stories, encourage him, and ask him questions to further along the conversation.

,Marriage,"At least I think it was funny, but then I’ve been told that I have a pretty weird sense of humor.

My fiance and I had made plans to elope on a Friday. We both had to work for a few hours in the morning, but would meet at my house (we lived about an hour apart), get dressed up, go the courthouse in the afternoon, and exchange our vows and rings. We also had a date planned for that evening – dinner, the symphony, maybe get dessert afterwards, and spend our wedding night in a nice hotel downtown. We planned to go out of state the next day for the following week for our honeymoon (play on the beach, do some touristy things, etc). We had an appointment at the courthouse, tickets were purchased, and all our reservations had been meticulously planned and made (typical for us).

I tend to get very stressed when there’s a lot of change in a short period of time. And there was LOT that was going to change. I was getting married (2nd marriage for me, 1st marriage for him), he would be changing jobs (he had accepted a nice offer where I work) and would be completely moving in with me in a few weeks. We would be fully merging our lives and our finances. Oh, and last but not least, we were also expecting a baby (our first was born 6 months later). Other than that, life would just be the usual (eat, sleep, go to work, repeat).

All of this was going through my mind as I got ready for bed that night. As I recall, I slept surprisingly well.

I like to wake up to music in the morning, but the next morning I woke up before the alarm went off. While lying in bed, this thought popped into my mind – *the day is here, hopefully this is a new beginning, and regardless of what happens today, one way or another life will never be the same*.

**NEVER.**

Wow. So I laid there in bed slightly dosing with this thought rolling around in my mind.

Then the alarm went off:

*It's the end of the world as we know it*

*It's the end of the world as we know it*

*It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine*

I am totally serious! I remember lying there listening to this and just started laughing. The refrain from that song kept going through my head for most of the day.

That evening over dinner, I told my new husband what had happened that morning. We both got a good chuckle out of it. Every time I hear that song, I smile and think of the day that my old life ended and my new life began.

By the way, everything that day, our honeymoon, and the events that followed went fairly smooth.

,Marriage,"We’ve been married for 4 months now and the amount of times I’ve contemplated divorce is sad. I love him so much. While we were dating he was much more attentive, complimented me all the time, we’d talk every day, have both deep conversations and sexy conversations. Honestly for a long while I wasn’t that into him while we were dating, my love for him grew because he seemed to love me so much. 

Fast forward, as newlyweds we had a very stressful beginning. It happened real fast, we got married at a courthouse and I moved in with him. The first couple months ended up being a whole stress over our living situation, transportation issues, a crap load of mess that I was the main one handling. He got stressed and started treating me real crappy when I was basically keeping both of our lives afloat and staying positive about the situation. I openly threatened to leave him and he got his act together for a bit.

Now our life is much more stable albeit financial issues but that’s pretty normal. I’m not sitting here saying I’m a perfect wife (I have mood swings, I can be annoying, etc) but I’m confident that I’m a good one. I keep the house clean, I cook for him, I work, I try to be respectful, I apologize easily, and I’m an entire sex freak. 

He treats me like I’m disposable. I’m a vocal person so I literally ask him for attention when I want it; he literally shakes his head and goes back to watching YouTube (which is all he does all day). I like love to be expressed through touching and sweet words, I like attention, he knows these things. But he just insists that’s not him and continues to ignore me. I come home from work and share some parts of what happened during my day with him and he doesn’t even lift his head from his phone to make any kind of response. Its not even like he’s tired from a long day of work, he doesn’t have a job at the moment, cause he keeps leaving jobs or getting laid off. He’s even disinterested in having sex with me. I’ll admit I like a lot of sex (I could do it at least twice a day) but the thing is he used to be the same way which makes his disinterest concerning. He doesn’t even seem interested in cuddling anymore. At first I was very concerned he was cheating on me but I now doubt that.

Honesty he seems depressed to me which I’ve expressed to him but the topic never went further than that. I would totally support him getting therapy or whatever but he’d rather just act like a brick laying in bed all day not talking watching YouTube. It’s really frustrating me cause I feel like I’ve never gotten to experience the happy blissful honeymoon stage. We immediately turned into a couple that’s been married for 20+ years. Smh. I love him so much and despite all this still desire to be with him, it just hurts that my feelings don’t seem reciprocated, and that’s what makes me want to just throw in the towel and find someone who will appreciate me and make me feel loved.

I'm not happy in my marriage. I've been happy before, but it was temporary (2-3 months). We've always fought over seemingly trivial things, but the recurring issues for me are that he doesn't seem to respect me sometimes. For years I've been told I'm overreacting to things, or interpreting things the wrong way, or that because he wouldn't care if I did X then I shouldn't care if he does it. He also talks down to me pretty often and then claims that's just how he talks. But I've never heard him talk to anyone else in this manner. Honestly, I just feel like I've been gaslighted for the past 10+ years. And he’s been verbally abusive and scared me on at least two occasions. I walk around nervous for the next argument, and I dread the weekends because it means we will undoubtedly argue. I’m just not sure I can fully love him anymore. I’m not happy, and every little argument just seems to prove my point that we’re not compatible.

,Marriage," This is going to be long and I am not sure where to start, I guess with a little background. I am 49 years old and have had ADD/ADHD all my life, now more just the ADD. In elementary I was a wild child and was the class clown etc., hated being still and found classwork boring. I was diagnosed in elementary school and they put me on ritalin. I was on that for a few years and then they took me off the medication, not quite sure why other than they maybe thought I had outgrown it at the time(this is before they knew about adult ADD). 

  
   Anyway I struggled with all the usual ADD stuff but managed to get a degree and all that. Shortly after I graduated college and was struggling at being a grownup I saw a 60 minutes episode on adult ADD and thought it described me exactly. So I visited the requisite mental health professionals, they gave me some psychological tests and reviewed my history and I got diagnosed again with adult ADD, this is in the early to mid 90's. I took ritalin for a few years and at first it really helped me, but after a while I didn't think it was helping as much so they put me on Adderall.  Adderall interfered with my sex life so I gave it up, and I also moved for a new job anyway so I was no longer getting treatment.   

  
  I have not had much trouble getting into relationships, just trouble keeping them.  Women have always found me attractive because I am ""exciting"" and ""adventurous"" and ""artistic and creative"" unlike all the other ""boring"" men who wanted to date them(their words, not mine). I also think that when I was young girlfriends would put up with more of my ADD stuff because they thought I was physically attractive so I didn't learn great coping skills for relationships then. Anyway when it comes to settling down and and dealing with the shit of everyday life I have always struggled in relationships. 

  
  I got married and had a beautiful daughter who is now just starting college this year, but unfortunately because of my ADD and stubbornness about things that first marriage ended  up in divorce when I was 34.  After the shock of everything I went back to a mental health professional and told them about my ADD, to little too late for that relationship but I knew I had to do something at that  point.  So anyway they prescribed  me dexadrine after I told them about what happened with the other drugs. He also proscribed wellbutrin because he thought I had mild depression as well.   

  
  So things were going alright, this was around the time online dating was becoming a thing so I did that and never had trouble getting dates, actually wished this stuff was around when I was younger  lol. So a few years after my divorce I met my current  wife through  online dating and  after about a year and a half of  dating we got married. I was 39 and she was 34. She had been engaged but never married and no kids. Anyway  we started a family and I now have a son who is 6 and a daughter who is 4 with my second wife.   

  
  It is the same story with her, she found me exciting to be with and good  looking when we were dating,  but when it came to everyday life and living together we struggled with the usual ADD stuff.  The medication unfortunately is not a panacea for everything ADD. As with ritalin after a while the stuff seems to lose its efficacy and for that reason I got into the habit of not taking it all the time, but only for when I had to concentrate at work and things like that. Also I crashed at the end of the day and that would hurt our relationship too. I also feel I am more outgoing,  funny,  and creative when I am not on the medication, so like when we are out socializing  I do not like being on it.    

  
  Anyway unfortunately things got worse after we had our first kid. My wife already suffered from some anxiety and  OCD. After the birth of our son she had severe post partum  depression and that put a strain on our relationship. It also made her anxiety and OCD worse long term. I really tried the best I could and actually had to do a  lot of taking care of the baby when she was too depressed, but then she got mad  at me for not being there  for her (because I was too busy taking care of our baby and holding down the house). We somehow got through that but with the birth of our daughter it only made things worse. again   I love my children, my family is my life and I would do anything for my children, but children are  a lot of work , especially for someone with ADD.  My mother suggested we seek counseling and so we started going to the therapist that my wife  had gone to before she met me.  We have been going for several years now. Things will seemingly be better between us for a while then the same old shit seemed to get dredged up again without any real resolution.   

  
  The specific issues I think are mostly ADD related. I struggle to keep my end of the bargain when it comes to household chores.  She feels I am not being an equal  partner in the relationship. Then when she gets mad  I get that adrenaline rush and am able to keep up with things on the home front for  a while, and promise her in therapy that I will be a better husband and be there for her(honestly sometimes I struggle to even know what that means, because I think I am there  for her a lot of the time). But then after a while I start to let my guard down when I get more relaxed and think everything is going fine.   

  
  She thinks I do things(more like don't do them) because I don't care  about her and  don't truly love her. But I feel no matter how much I try I can't keep it up and just go back to my old ADD self. I don't intend to break my promises, I feel  I am forced to make them in therapy to save the marriage and I am unable to keep them no matter how much I want to.   

   
  I also feel this therapist my unintentionally be  biased because  she  had a relationship with my wife  before. In fact this same therapist convinced my wife to dump her boyfriend before me  because that  boyfriend was no good for her. I am wondering if the therapist at some level feels the same  way about me.  I just feel like when I am in there everything is my fault  and  at  times feel like they gang up on me. I don't know if this therapist  really understands adult ADD. I know she knows something about it because there are books on her bookshelf about it, but they mostly are about children with ADD and I have no idea if she has actually read them anyway.    

  
  She thinks one of my big problems is avoidance issues stemming from some psychological  issues  that must have happened in my childhood. I have a developmentally disabled brother and my parents were not there for me growing up as much because my brother took so much of my time. Basically I  procrastinate and am stubborn about stuff, even if I know I should be doing it. Besides household chores, it is stuff like being consistent going to the dentist(which I hate), and the doctor. She thinks I need to go to the doctor for a couple of reasons-she has been pestering me about my weight recently, I am maybe 15-20 pounds overweight since we had our children.  I have tried to diet recently but find it difficult to do on my own. I am constantly tempted by stuff, another ADD trait. For instance, last weekend we baked halloween sugar cookies  with my kids, not the healthiest thing. And of  course I had to try one, then another,  and there is still a bag full  of sugar cookies sitting in the fridge at home waiting for me  to be tempted again.  Combine this with a very busy life with work and two kids and it is a struggle to find time to exercise as well.   

  
  So back to the doctor stuff, she thinks I need  to talk with the doctor about my weight and about a  diet, and  get  blood work done  and all that. Additionally and this is what is really annoying to me is she now thinks I also have sleep aponea. Her sister is a doctor and has been on this kick where she thinks I need to be tested because I snore and am a few  pounds overweight now.  When I researched it said that sleep aponea is generally caused by orthodontic problems, things like narrow jaws and a recessed chin, and people who have had braces are more likely to have this condition. I never wore braces, never had  a problem with teeth crowding, have a nice wide square jaw and I don't have a recessed chin or overbite, I even measured my face to make sure. So I told my wife that is B.S. And there is no way I could have it. So her sis says that other things can cause it like being overweight can cause it and my wife is still insisting I get tested even though it seems like a huge PITA to me when I probably don't have it, and I can just lose the weight rather than be stuck having to breathe through a mask when I sleep for the rest of my life.   

  
  Anyway this is where we were at during last nights therapy session. I actually did set a doctors appointment before we went to it but it didn't seem to matter. My wife brought up how stubborn I am and she was sick and tired of having to be the one to prod me to do stuff and not procrastinate. The therapist, like she has in the past talked about how I have an avoidance issue and she ignores the ADD aspect of it altogether. My wife and I had a little fight about cleaning this weekend but I didn't think it was serious and got resolved quickly.  But it came up in therapy, when the therapist pushed me into telling her that.  Then she dredges stuff up from our past, things that we had struggled with and I thought we were actually doing better on. 

  
  It then felt like the two were  ganging up on me and the therapist asking why I haven't kept my promises, and that it is causing anger and resentment in my wife. I could be wrong but I   think by my therapist bringing it up it caused those memories to come flooding back into my wife. So then I felt like I was being pressured to answer as to why I haven't kept my promises, and my wife sobbing and saying I don't care about her.   

  
  The reason I haven't kept my promises  is again I tried to, I never intended to break them, but my stupid ADD gets in the way. I also admit my stubbornness get in the way and that I probably can work on and change. But I feel I cannot change my ADDness. God knows I have tried too. So at that moment I got angry, threw my hands up and stormed  out of there because I felt there was nothing I could do. At that moment I felt I was just not good enough and never could be. I also had to go to the bathroom, so I did that and after calming down a bit went back in there.     
  But I am really beginning to doubt that  this particular therapist and therapy is really helping our relationship. The morning before we went in we had sex, and  were all lovey dovey when we had dinner before the session. After the session my wife was all cold, wouldn't even let me touch her, and  would not tell me she still loved me. How the hell is that helping our marriage? It just doesn't seem like this therapy is working, we go round and round with the same old shit but nothing ever gets resolved permanently.   

  
  It did get me thinking though. She has OCD and when she sees a mess she can't stand it and it triggers her OCD. In my mind I don't think it is a big deal, because my brain doesn't get anxious about it I forget that her brain does. So I think I need to read about and study what makes her brain tick and by understanding her better have more empathy for what she is going through. But at the same time she needs to do that with ADD. She needs to understand why I do what I do, and it is not because I don't care about her. What do you guys think?   

  
  Anyway I am beginning to doubt this therapist because she doesn't touch on that stuff, it is all about me and it is all my fault. I feel like maybe we need to find a therapist who specializes in ADD and relationship issues, or at least seems to understand them better. FWIW I think the kind of therapy we are doing is called cognitive behavioral therapy.  The credential title after the therapist name is something  like MCSW. I think that means that she has a degree in social work and a marriage counseling license.   

  
  I don't want to blame it all on my ADD and not do anything, I just think we need someone who understands this stuff. The other thing is my ADD treatment has mostly consisted of visiting the shrink for 15 minutes and getting my prescription from them. I have never had actual counseling or coaching from someone who can teach me coping skills and skills for living with ADD.  I feel that may also help me as nothing else seems to have worked.     
  I really want this marriage to stay together, my wife has many good qualites-she is a very loving and caring person and after she recovered from the postpartum depression has been a great mother to our children.  I don't want to fail a second time at marriage. I also don't want another man in our house raising my children for me.   

  
  After my first marriage failed I only got to see my daughter on weekends and part of the summer and some holidays, and I feel I missed out a lot on seeing her growing up. I am very proud of everything she has done so far but I wish I could have been there more day to day. Another man did end up sharing the household with her and my ex. He seems like just the opposite of the kind of guy I thought my ex  would go for- an engineer who works for a major computer company making chips, the kind of guy who she thought was too boring for her. He reminds me of your stereotypical accountant lol.  I have gotten to know him picking up my daughter and seems like an okay guy though. Still, I don't want  that to happen again, I want to keep my family together this time. I really want to be able to resolve things  with my wife and have a stable relationship and am at  a  loss  on how this  can work out without something changing. 

sorry for the long post, I don't know how to condense it and keep all the important info

TL;DR I have struggled with ADD/ADHD all my life, we are seeing a marriage counselor who I feel doesn't understand me and I got angry and walked out of the session yesterday. I am unsure what to do now but I don't feel this is the right therapist and I want to save our marriage.",t2_4sz8rqz3,False,,0,False,"My wife and I are getting marriage counseling and I got angry and walked out yesterday, unsure what to do now. I struggle with ADHD and feel this is the wrong therapist.",[],r/Marriage,False,6,,0,,False,t3_difadi,False,dark,,public,4,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,self,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1571205794.0,text,6,,text,self.Marriage,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is going to be long and I am not sure where to start, I guess with a little background. I am 49 years old and have had ADD/ADHD all my life, now more just the ADD. In elementary I was a wild child and was the class clown etc., hated being still and found classwork boring. I was diagnosed in elementary school and they put me on ritalin. I was on that for a few years and then they took me off the medication, not quite sure why other than they maybe thought I had outgrown it at the time(this is before they knew about adult ADD). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I struggled with all the usual ADD stuff but managed to get a degree and all that. Shortly after I graduated college and was struggling at being a grownup I saw a 60 minutes episode on adult ADD and thought it described me exactly. So I visited the requisite mental health professionals, they gave me some psychological tests and reviewed my history and I got diagnosed again with adult ADD, this is in the early to mid 90&amp;#39;s. I took ritalin for a few years and at first it really helped me, but after a while I didn&amp;#39;t think it was helping as much so they put me on Adderall.  Adderall interfered with my sex life so I gave it up, and I also moved for a new job anyway so I was no longer getting treatment.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not had much trouble getting into relationships, just trouble keeping them.  Women have always found me attractive because I am &amp;quot;exciting&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;adventurous&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;artistic and creative&amp;quot; unlike all the other &amp;quot;boring&amp;quot; men who wanted to date them(their words, not mine). I also think that when I was young girlfriends would put up with more of my ADD stuff because they thought I was physically attractive so I didn&amp;#39;t learn great coping skills for relationships then. Anyway when it comes to settling down and and dealing with the shit of everyday life I have always struggled in relationships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got married and had a beautiful daughter who is now just starting college this year, but unfortunately because of my ADD and stubbornness about things that first marriage ended  up in divorce when I was 34.  After the shock of everything I went back to a mental health professional and told them about my ADD, to little too late for that relationship but I knew I had to do something at that  point.  So anyway they prescribed  me dexadrine after I told them about what happened with the other drugs. He also proscribed wellbutrin because he thought I had mild depression as well.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So things were going alright, this was around the time online dating was becoming a thing so I did that and never had trouble getting dates, actually wished this stuff was around when I was younger  lol. So a few years after my divorce I met my current  wife through  online dating and  after about a year and a half of  dating we got married. I was 39 and she was 34. She had been engaged but never married and no kids. Anyway  we started a family and I now have a son who is 6 and a daughter who is 4 with my second wife.   &lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"My husband ( 65 M) and I the wife ( 56 F) have for the most part have had a comfortable marriage. He and I dated for 4 years before becoming domestic. On our 5th year, we bought our first house, fell pregnant with our first child, and married. At this point we have been together almost 32 years. Our children became my life, and our life together as in ( us) became no more. We worked, we went on family vacations.

Roughly three years in, he abruptly broke up with me and moved out, and two months later returned and proposed. Things were...tumultuous after that. We went to therapy immediately, and we learned how to communicate. Anyway, we've had a lot on our plate since then. For years, he lived with his mom to help take care of his dad. I helped as well, though I maintained my own home. I loved his dad more than I can say and, almost two years after his death I'm still not ok. I know this is a rambling story, but it's difficult to sum up nine years and two lives into a neat little story, you know? 

Anyway, we finally get married. It was a joy that I've never known. But it hit me fairly quickly that my husband is depressed- and he always has been, he HAS depression. He was in therapy for awhile and stopped going. He hasn't been since before his dad died. But it feels overwhelming... Kind of like ever since we got married he's just depressed and worried about money all the time. I fought so hard and for so long for this and now...what? I've talked to him about going to therapy, and he's said he will several times. He hasn't followed through yet. How do I get through to him that he has to, for his sake and mine and ours, and still be supportive of him? I feel adrift and alone.

,Marriage,"*DISCLAIMER* IM POSTING MY ENTIRE BACK STORY....

When do you cut the cord in a marriage?.. How could anyone ever know that there MAY be a ""better"" relationship out there for you to possibly find one day?

What if I continue to find relationships that seem fulfilling and healthy, just to find out it was some other form of trouble?

I am no newby to commitment.

I had a childhood sweetheart, who I bounced between best friends, crushes and boyfriend/gf with for 5 years.  We were super close and protective of one an other.

My childhood sweetheart moved away.. and things changed.

I later met my high school sweetheart at 15.. we were INSEPARABLE through high school AND college and a bit beyond.  Lived together, had a dog, etc.. got ENGAGED.. and eventually dwindled down to our anxtie teenage self's and parted ways.  We were joined at the hip for nearly 8 years. 

After that break up, and my parents divorce, I was now an adult, and moved away.  I met a new guy (originally from California...I'm  from Michigan).. and he rocked my world!!! We were together through our late 20s.. for about 5 years.  We had a daughter together, but he and I parted ways before she turned 2 &amp; he moved back to California.

About a year later.. I was shopping and an employee approached me, complimented me etc..(odd lol).. and when I paid, he told the cashier to give me his employee discount, because if he ever sees me again, hes going to make me his wife. (Weird haha)..

Needless to say, he followed through, we met again, he took me on the best date of my lifetime, meshed with me beyond words &amp; stole my heart.  

Now in our 30s, we are married.  He adopted my daughter from my previous relationship &amp; we had our own child as well.. a little boy.

Things finally seemed AMAZING!!!!!!

But its not tho.. after I became pregnant with OUR child, he changed.
He became hostile over everything &amp; nothing.. SCREAMING at strangers on the road while driving.. saying shitty comments to elderly people in the grocery store under his breath but loud enough for everyone to notice. Literally becoming a loose cannon.  

He is obsessed with our son.. he's always been a good dad.. plays with them daily, changes diapers, sings to them, shares ice cream, whatever..

He also never failed to praise me and love me every day.

HOWEVER... he has OUTBURSTS.. like, terrible, traumatizing outbursts over anything now.. 

Our son is about to be 2.. and he has been unpredictable since I was pregnant with the baby.

I know he's under stress, I know he is overwhelmed.. but the things he says and SCREAMS almost daily now is putting me in a corner. 

I literally hide from him when he comes home... 
He terrorizes the children with his anger issues...
He REFUSES counseling or help.. and he has even yelled at my mother once.

He makes fun of my sister and all of my friends.  He tells the kids to ""shut up"" casually, &amp; laughs...

But at the end of the night, he tells me how wonderful I am and how he doesn't know how he could ever live without me etc etc... just like when we first started dating.  

I like to imagine there is a different man hiding inside.. the one I fell in love with.. but I dont know anymore.  Maybe it's me?.. maybe it's the pressure of children &amp; life?.. how long should I make excuses for his rash behavior?  If ever at all?

Hes a goddamn nightmare most of the time.  But then he switched it off and acts like his old self. 

The kids and I are on a rollercoaster and he is terrifying.. to the point I'm afraid to even tell him this.  

What if I ask for divorce and just fall into another long relationship that parts ways?.. how do you know when it's really worth giving up? Or if you see the good hiding inside someone &amp; stand strong by their side to help them let it out?... 

I understand marriage is though and life is hard.. and some partners are worth fighting for!  But is it time for me to end it?

Lived together, had a dog, etc.. got ENGAGED.. and eventually dwindled down to our anxtie teenage self&amp;#39;s and parted ways.  We were joined at the hip for nearly 8 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that break up, and my parents divorce, I was now an adult, and moved away.  I met a new guy (originally from California...I&amp;#39;m  from Michigan).. and he rocked my world!!! We were together through our late 20s.. for about 5 years.  We had a daughter together, but he and I parted ways before she turned 2 &amp;amp; he moved back to California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year later.. I was shopping and an employee approached me, complimented me etc..(odd lol).. and when I paid, he told the cashier to give me his employee discount, because if he ever sees me again, hes going to make me his wife. (Weird haha)..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, he followed through, we met again, he took me on the best date of my lifetime, meshed with me beyond words &amp;amp; stole my heart.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in our 30s, we are married.  He adopted my daughter from my previous relationship &amp;amp; we had our own child as well.. a little boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things finally seemed AMAZING!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But its not tho.. after I became pregnant with OUR child, he changed.
He became hostile over everything &amp;amp; nothing.. SCREAMING at strangers on the road while driving.. saying shitty comments to elderly people in the grocery store under his breath but loud enough for everyone to notice. Literally becoming a loose cannon.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is obsessed with our son.. he&amp;#39;s always been a good dad.. plays with them daily, changes diapers, sings to them, shares ice cream, whatever..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also never failed to praise me and love me every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOWEVER... he has OUTBURSTS.. like, terrible, traumatizing outbursts over anything now.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our son is about to be 2.. and he has been unpredictable since I was pregnant with the baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know he&amp;#39;s under stress, I know he is overwhelmed.. but the things he says and SCREAMS almost daily now is putting me in a corner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I literally hide from him when he comes home... 
He terrorizes the children with his anger issues...
He REFUSES counseling or help.. and he has even yelled at my mother once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He makes fun of my sister and all of my friends.  He tells the kids to &amp;quot;shut up&amp;quot; casually, &amp;amp; laughs...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the end of the night, he tells me how wonderful I am and how he doesn&amp;#39;t know how he could ever live without me etc etc... just like when we first started dating.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to imagine there is a different man hiding inside.. the one I fell in love with.. but I dont know anymore.  Maybe it&amp;#39;s me?.. maybe it&amp;#39;s the pressure of children &amp;amp; life?.. how long should I make excuses for his rash behavior?  If ever at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hes a goddamn nightmare most of the time.  But then he switched it off and acts like his old self. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kids and I are on a rollercoaster and he is terrifying.. to the point I&amp;#39;m afraid to even tell him this.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I ask for divorce and just fall into another long relationship that parts ways?.. how do you know when it&amp;#39;s really worth giving up? Or if you see the good hiding inside someone &amp;amp; stand strong by their side to help them let it out?... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand marriage is though and life is hard.. and some partners are worth fighting for!  But is it time for me to end it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HELP.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"I've never been high or drunk or drank really at all. I am 31 F. Husband is 42 M and is now smoking weed again after being clean of it pretty much since we've been together. He is also drinking on a regular basis and has gotten drunk so badly he urinated in my purse one night.

He has these one person parties and it makes me pretty upset for 3 reasons. 1, I am not included nor does he care that the exclusion makes me feel more upset and betrayed because I can never join in on what he deems to be the best feeling in the world to him. 2, he smokes weed in secrecy but has me buy it from my ex husbands co worker. I am his weed mule and he hides it still and smokes it the minute he can escape me. He wont even speak of it to me or answer my questions he even hides his pipe and materials I've never seen them. When he doesn't have weed and smells other people's weed he throws tantrums which makes me feel bullied into buying it. 3, he is the father to a 7 month old baby, our son, and when he is messed up the care is all on me. I find it unfair he can do these things and make me buy his high and leave me also with the full responsibility.

I understand that I missed the high and drunk train as a parent I ought to never do that. But why does a man get to and not a mother? He makes me feel like I am the only sober person on the planet he has never met someone who has never been drunk or high. I am really hurt now by this and if I didnt have the responsibility of parenting I'd go to a bar and smoke weed in secrecy as he does to just slap him back with it all. 

And to make matters worse he tells me all his joy of his past relationship with his ex baby mama who got high and drunk with him all the time and how happy they were. I get to hear how they always smoked together and yet he hides everything from me and shares nothing positive with me at all. He just goes to work gets high when I'm gone and sleeps.

,Marriage,"Me and my husband have been together 5 years. Ever since getting married though our sex drive has changed a lot. Well, his not mine. I have a high sex drive, but don't masturbate if that makes sense. He had only had sex once before he met me. He masturbates and buys photos/follows porn people.

I didn't know my husband did this until after we got married. I would not have married him if I had known that information beforehand. Not the masturbation - the buying photos and browsing NSFW subreddits.

We do have sex 2-3x a week, but my husband would be happier if it were less than. He says he's not asexual. He just prefers touch to sex and stress from work makes him not in the mood.

My husband recently admitted to me that sometimes he doesn't feel sexy. I send him flirty texts, touch him at random times like when he's cooking in the kitchen, remind him with lunch notes, etc. etc. I don't know what else I could be doing and when I asked he said he had no idea.

Well, sometimes I don't feel sexy either and I hate to blame him for it, but it's because of what he does. I know for a fact I would feel 10000% sexy if he wasn't looking at other women. It just doesn't make sense to have a low sex drive and not want to have sex with me, but he can masturbate to some random woman's photo. I send him photos and videos all the time. I'm always dressing up in lingerie.

I feel like telling him that I don't feel sexy because of the things he does, but I don't want to control him so whenever it comes up I just sweep it under the rug. I really don't want to tell him what he can and can't do. I just want to blurt out that I'd never had married him if he had admitted sooner he bought photos.

So I've suggested several times if we could go to therapy and he just brushes it off. He says it might be good for me, but doesn't want to go with me. I'm not going without him. Honestly, I feel he's the one who needs it most. I know why I'm upset and I know my feelings are valid. It's normal to not feel good enough but reassurance isn't the key. I'm willing to change in any shape or form, but he's never going to change.

,Marriage,"We started off great. Super in love and super happy. He’s still a good guy and i know he loves me, but right now we are at a low point in our marriage. Since we had a baby 9 months ago things have been so up and down. I thought i loved my husband, but these days i feel like i have two babies to take care of. 
Our son had a sore throat for three days now so he’s been completely miserable and since im the one taking care of him 90% of the time, it’s safe to say im just as miserable. I went to take our son to the doctor yesterday, while my husband decided that the gym was more important to him. I was stuck in traffic for 30 minutes with a sick and crying baby, and when i told my husband he said well i could’ve just waited for him (by the time he comes back from the gym it would’ve been 7pm). Last night our son didn’t sleep until 3:30 in the morning and my husband spent the whole day complaining that the baby interrupted his sleep and he couldn’t function properly all day at work. I was up all night trying to comfort our sick son and he’s complaining about him not getting enough sleep (btw baby sleeps in his own room so i was there with him all night, but the crying “disturbed” DH). We both work, but I’m taking a couple of months off until i start a new job, so i get how important sleep is, but we have a sick baby for god’s sake. 
today was really hectic as well but thank god i managed to get the baby to sleep early. And DH was fast asleep by 10. Anyway, around 12 i was starving and decided to get something to eat, so i made a bowl of cereal in the kitchen and when i went back to the room DH started yelling at me for waking him up! I was flabbergasted and i wanted to just scream at him. I ignored him and went back to bed fuming. 
The nerve on that man!! I’ve been going nuts trying to balance everything since our son was born, meanwhile he’s doing the bare minimum and i get yelled at for getting up to eat. I was especially upset at that because he knows how much i struggle with food, I’m the type that doesn’t eat when im stressed so since the baby came i lost over 40lbs and my bones are literally sticking out and he knows all about that. 
I’m just really tired and drained. He puts so much pressure on me to take care of everything and everyone; he doesn’t do much to support me at home and he doesn’t support us financially all that well either.

,Marriage,"My bf(34m) and I (26f) are living together and speaking of marriage in the next 4 years or so. 

We live in a small home in an okay area but it’s not the best living circumstance
 (Except not terrible either) 

We had a talk about a future real home (one where we can choose it together, since I had moved into his home) and we briefly discussed what that would look like. 

He said he could buy a home, and he would be willing to move since I don’t feel safe where we are currently although I told him I don’t just want to be moving around “his houses” it would be nice if we could have a joint place. 

He said if we move and he pays 100% (which he has the funds to) then the house is 100% under his name. And if I come up with half (about $450k) it would be “ours” and it would be under my name too. 

I feel deeply the next house should be ours. We both want a life together, and I just want to be able to make equal choices with him. In choosing the house,  neighborhood, furnishings etc. I simply want to feel like it’s my house too. (I am a loyal and committed partner, we work together &amp; I help with the bills that I can) 

However 

Because he’s older he has a business 
Because I’m younger - I’m a student 
Because he’s stable he has a nice car and the house he has now 
Because I’m a student I don’t have much to my name except a few grand I’m saving by penny pinching to finish school 

So- hear me out. How can I compromise with my significant other - where I can “catch up” finish school, get a degree and start a career so I can BEGIN  to make money for a home 

And where do I meet him in the middle? 

Is it worth the pride to live in a somewhat unsafe place so I can move on with my life and help pay for a house in the following years?

,Marriage,"My fiancée and I have been dealing with some issues together that aren't deal breaking, but need to be worked through.  

Last night she had a long talk with her mom after we had a quick argument and she told me she wants to postpone the wedding.  We are supposed to get married in 7ish months but she wants to focus on us and get back to where we should be.

Things that need to be worked on generally are for me to handle my memory issues.  I have PTSD and am on medication for it.  I believe it is causing issues where I forget to do things and my fiancée has to finish it later on.  I totally understand that frustration and I've already talked to a therapist and have a doctor's appointment this week.  

She has resentment towards me feeling like she's my mom instead of partner and she can be a bit easy to get angry, which she fully admits she needs to work on.

We are pushing for couple's counseling.  I think it's something we don't need to postpone the wedding but can work through in the 7 months, she feels like it isn't enough time and we need to focus on us right now and not the wedding.

I feel like she's right, but I don't want to reach out to all the guests and have to cancel.  I truly think we can get through this before next year.

For context - He(31m) has a very busy life and is managing a lot of things professionally. Im working on my own thing and I’m financially dependent.

His issues - He thinks I’m not being an equal partner in the marriage and he has to oversee things in the house as well as work. His standards are pretty high and he expects either everything to be done correctly.  I should take complete ownership and there should be no scope of failure. If things do not work out, he’ll stop talking for days and now months. The silent treatments are why our issues are never resolved.

My issues - He is very narrow in his view point of what he sees. Anything that does not happen according to his standards - he’ll get annoyed and stop talking to me for days. He is more observant and he is more productive than me and will take care of what he needs around the house. Now I’m all for improving and have changed a lot about myself but I believe mistakes will still be made and cutting off emotionally, physically is highly abusive. The silent treatments are something that is affecting me a lot.

We are at a point that even though I see the issues that he is having with me, I can’t get past the emotional abuse and just the general loneliness and lack of understanding and respect in this marriage. He has already told me that he doesn’t want to resolve anything and that we should lead separate lives. I don’t think there is any point in trying to resolve anything since he has already made up his mind.

,Marriage,"My wife and I have been married for less than a year and we just moved in together in March. We’ve talked about getting dogs on and off (she’s always been the one to bring it up) and we’d agreed that someday we’ll get them. Last time we discussed it - about a month ago - she was showing me photos of dogs on Craigslist, but we agreed it would be best that we hold off for now as I’m unemployed and looking for work, and we have other priorities at the moment. I’ve liked the balance we have - we’re still a new couple, we get to spend a good amount of time together, travel when we want, visit friends out of town, etc. Yesterday she picked me up from an acupuncture appointment and when I got in the car she showed me a dog she’d found on Craigslist that needed a home - it’s the kind of dog she wants, not necessarily one I would choose - as she likes a certain type and I have my own preference. She asked if she could get him and I said “I support you with whatever you want to do.” This was clearly a mistake -I think I said it because I didn’t want to feel like I’m standing in the way of something that she wants. However, each time she would bring up the conversation I would temper it and suggest we hold off a bit longer - but continually it gets brought up. I think she was wearing me down. I didn't even know she was looking at dogs on Craigslist again. I don’t really know what the rush is when we haven’t lived together for long.

We were long distance and I moved from my city, (SF - LA) leaving behind family and job opportunities, so I feel like I’ve made all the sacrifices for us to be together. I’ve been looking for work for a while, but I still pay my share of rent and expenses. She has a steady job and makes good money.

She started texting with the owner and it snowballed - truthfully I didn’t think it would even get very far as she said the owner told her there was a lot of interest in the dog. Yesterday when I was half asleep and she was halfway out the door on her way to work she said she was putting a deposit down. I questioned this, saying should you really send a stranger from Craigslist money? She said she trusted the person. She’d also set up a visit for us to go and look at him after she gets off work.

We drove out and she loved the dog. She could tell that I wasn’t expressing any interest in him and had reservations. She asked how I was feeling, was I upset, etc and I told her I really didn’t think this was in our plans, I thought we’d agreed to wait, and yet here we are… I don’t feel like she listened to me. Ultimately I said I guess she could take him, as I didn't have it in me to say no when she clearly really wanted him. The situation for the dog wasn't dire at all - he had a home but the family was growing as they have another baby on the way.  I wasn’t stronger in my opposition because I didn’t want to stand in the way of something that she wants. Now we have the dog, she knows I’m upset about it, and I feel like I’m in a lose - lose situation because it would be heartless for me to allow her to give him up, (she offered) but I also don’t want a dog right now. Now I just feel sad because I look into the dog's eyes and I think of my wife and what she feels inside. 

When we'd talked about it in the past she'd said that I could choose a dog first since I've never actually had one of my own. With this situation I feel like everything we'd discussed and agreed on went out the window as she is pretty impulsive. For the record - I love dogs, and I know I would grow attached to this one over time too. In a very traumatic past relationship my ex girlfriend I had a dog and over time he became ours as I took care of him a lot of the time and we had a really deep bond - but she has him now, and my heart is still broken over the fact that I can’t see him anymore. I think it’s triggering some bad memories for me and while my wife knows about that situation, she’s a little obtuse to the complexity of my feelings. I know I need to deal with those feelings from the past, but I don’t really know where to begin with resolving that situation, as I was in therapy for years and it still haunts me.

,Marriage,"My husband (33m) and I(32f) have been married almost 2 years. I had our first child together 3 months ago, (my second child- his first. Pre-pregnancy, I knew he liked to watch porn;I was open to making it a thing we could enjoy together until I realized he was still also enjoying it when he was alone,  many times it was durung the half hour or so before bed when id be preoccupied with my end if the day routine. It made me uncomfortable and I asked him to please include me bc it seemed like he needed that to get aroused before he had sex with me. Ultimately we had to just agree to cut it out all together- I was falling back on my own old insecurity issues and since then porn surfing hadnt been an issue until abt a year later. A couple weeks ago, I found a ridiculous amount of porn in his phone. it made me feel bad about myself, i guess bc of being in a new post baby body, and maybe my hormones or whatever reason It hurt my selfimage, the women he watches are opposite of me in every way. He apologized and said he shouldn't have been trying to hide it etc The real problem has risen in the time since then. He hasnt done or said anything at all to help me pull myself out of this slump. He hasnt tried to reassure me that i turn him on or that im still sexy. Its making me lose my enthusiasm for our sex. The one time since then we were intimate he didn't try to make me climax at all. I feel like i dont matter, like my needs arent a priority. In the battle over porn, there is no way that one woman can/should ever compete with the world of adult entertainment.

Pre-pregnancy, I knew he liked to watch porn;I was open to making it a thing we could enjoy together until I realized he was still also enjoying it when he was alone,  many times it was durung the half hour or so before bed when id be preoccupied with my end if the day routine. It made me uncomfortable and I asked him to please include me bc it seemed like he needed that to get aroused before he had sex with me. Ultimately we had to just agree to cut it out all together- I was falling back on my own old insecurity issues and since then porn surfing hadnt been an issue until abt a year later. A couple weeks ago, I found a ridiculous amount of porn in his phone. it made me feel bad about myself, i guess bc of being in a new post baby body, and maybe my hormones or whatever reason It hurt my selfimage, the women he watches are opposite of me in every way. He apologized and said he shouldn&amp;#39;t have been trying to hide it etc The real problem has risen in the time since then. He hasnt done or said anything at all to help me pull myself out of this slump. He hasnt tried to reassure me that i turn him on or that im still sexy. Its making me lose my enthusiasm for our sex. The one time since then we were intimate he didn&amp;#39;t try to make me climax at all. I feel like i dont matter, like my needs arent a priority. In the battle over porn, there is no way that one woman can/should ever compete with the world of adult entertainment. Every size shape color age and position is readily available 24/7 online.  Am i overreacting and letting it affect me too much ? Should i just let it go ?&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,I've been married for only 2 years but with my husband for 4.5 years. We have 2 children together and get along well for the most part. Of course in the beginning there was a lot of sexual attraction and even 6 to 7 months ago I feel like there was more of an effort to find time for intimacy. He recently changed jobs but it was a positive change. He went from working 12 hours a day to only 8 hours with plenty of time to be home and get things done. I am in college and work under 20 hrs per week. I mostly take care of our kids if I'm not at school or working in the evening. Its been very evident that he was no sez drive and just doesn't want to have sex anymore. We are fairly young but with an 8 year gap. I'm 22 years old and he is 30 years old. I'll try to do things to get him in the mood and it just doesn't work anymore. I feel like I'm having to please myself more than he is willing to. I have attempted to bring this up and it always ends the same way with him saying it'll happen soon and it doesn't mean he isnt attracted to me. I honestly feel like there is a huge loss of attraction from him and he just has no want to have sex anymore and has no drive. I guess it just hurts that I feel like I can't turn him on anymore and that I basically have to bother him to have sex. We will still have sex maybe 1 to 2 times a month but it drastically decreased along with the amount of foreplay. Everything is just me pleasing him for a second and then sex before its finished. At times he will use toys but he has seemed very disinterested in it and doesn't seem as intrigued by it as before.

,Marriage," Throwaway account. Me \[F31\] and my husband \[M32\] have been together for 10 years, married for 5. I'm currently about 2 months pregnant with our first child. I've been experiencing pretty horrible all-day nausea and extreme fatigue for the past few weeks, not being able to eat much and it's taking a toll on me and my job. Unfortunately, I'm currently the only one working as my husband is changing careers and is actively searching for a job. Previously, he was teaching part-time, which didn't pay well and didn't provide any benefits, so we decided that he'd use this time to try and find a more stable job. So, currently, I'm the only one earning any income and cover rent, internet, gym, phone bills and marriage counseling sessions. He pays for electricity and most of the groceries. I've been supportive of his desire to change careers and hope that in the long run it will bring him more joy and increase our income.   


A few days ago, we had a conversation that we needed to reduce our expenses and just be more careful with 'discretionary spending' like eating out. I think we are doing pretty well, but still eat out about once a week which is within our budget (but also because I can't cook very often, and it's not my husband's forte). So on Saturday we went for a long walk and stopped for lunch. After that, we stopped at our friend's house to drop off a car that he left with us while traveling and ended up chatting for quite a while. Afterward, we went to a donut shop to get some water since both of us were pretty thirsty. I also decided to get a donut since not eating for a long time makes my nausea worse. So I take two bites out of my donut and save the rest for later. Earlier that day I also told him that I was really craving frozen yogurt and later on our walk we happened to walk by one of the frozen yogurt shops. I ask him if it was ok if I got some. His response: 'But you just got a donut!' I explained to him that I mainly got it to calm down my nausea before it'd gotten worse, but I was really craving frozen yogurt for a while. He makes a very dissatisfied face and I go into the store, buy a $4 yogurt with my own money and go outside to see him in a really pissy mood. He starts telling me how I didn't follow through with our agreement to reduce our expenses. I'm sorry, but it was a $2 donut and a 4$ yogurt! I already work really long and hard days, deal with constant nausea and overall feel like shit. I think I deserve to get myself whatever the hell I want with my own hard-earned money, especially because I'm pregnant!  
He wouldn't agree with me and it made me really upset and I stormed off to find a trash can to throw the stupid yogurt cause I didn't feel like having it anymore (I know I might've overreacted here). We went home in silence and haven't spoken since.  


He is otherwise very supportive and does most of the chores around the house (except cooking). We've also been seeing a therapist and working through other relationship issues recently, but I just cannot comprehend how he can act this way while I'm pregnant, feel terrible most of the time and work full-time.  


Please help me understand if there is anything I'm missing or where I might be wrong. Thank you for reading this far.

,Marriage,"I'll try to be brief, though there's many parts to this particular story.

Wife (39F) and I (37M) have been married for 11 years (12 in December). Short version is that right now we're at a point where we haven't had sex in almost 2 years, haven't even hugged or kissed in a long time. I've had issues with unemployment and depression in the past. Most recent being this year. Took a long time to get through a very low period of lack of confidence and self-esteem. I finally was able to climb out recently (like 2 months ago), and finally feel in control and getting back to being the man I know I can be. She seems to have checked out though.

A few things that I have noticed through this year that I was in the doldrums, is that we don't communicate. It was never great, but it's worse. Only thing we talk about are our son (4), and groceries. She no longer seeks my opinion on anything, doesn't really ask about what's going on in my life, and doesn't share what's going on in hers. We don't share in any financial decisions because my income has been very spotty.

I've approached her on a few occasions to talk about our lack of communication, as well as figure out how we can start to fix our issues. She hasn't really engaged. She sits, doesn't say much, then I finish speaking and nothing else happens. I feel like she's checked out completely. I know there's shit on both sides that needs dealing with, and I'm wanting to start this urgently, but she doesn't seem fussed.

She's planning to start her own consultancy business soon, but she never discussed this with me. More of just a mention than anything. She never even told me what her business is called, or even showed me the logo. This part hurts, because my business now IS a creative agency and I'm designing logos for people almost every day. I wouldn't be wrong to think that she thinks so little of me and my opinion that she wouldn't even share that.

I feel like her respect for me has gone completely. I don't know how to earn it back, and this next part is the hardest for me to reconcile - I don't know that I want to work to earn it back. Even at our best, the marriage was never the greatest, but I knew I had someone who had my back and I had hers. We had some similar lows in the past, but we fought through them and got stronger. This time feels different.

Anyway, that's where we are. She says there's a lot that is in her head that she's trying to sift through. I don't know what that means, but it feels like she's completely checked out, but doesn't want to pull the trigger on leaving. I'm trying to rebuild my own confidence and my own life as a man, and I'm willing to work to rebuild the marriage, but I don't know how that would be possible if she's not interested.

I feel like working to regain her respect will involve me having to do things that may/may not work, but also that will put all the responsibility for how our relationship has deteriorated on my shoulders (i.e. you lost your wife's respect which explains why she treats you like this), which also doesn't make sense to me.

,Marriage,"Hey there, thanks for stopping to read my post.

Married going on 6 years, together almost 10. We were surprised with twins last year, and pretty much I’ve been in a state of high anxiety and depression for the past few months. We have 4 kids under 5. I’m alone with them about 85 percent of the time. My husband and I come from very different backgrounds, and I’m really struggling with our lack of communication and planning.

I’ve asked him numerous times to go to see a financial advisor/counselor to help with a plan for saving. I’ve asked HIM to go and see someone. I’ve asked him to go to see a couples therapist together. I get steadfast no’s every time.

He’s trying to establish his own business, and I feel like it’s costing our family more than help. He says he’s looking for work, but that whenever he applies, he never hears back, that he doesn’t have the time to look and apply...I suggested getting his resume professionally done.  Find a head hunter. Nothing changes.

He has a law degree and an MBA.

Some of you may ask why I don’t get work? The cost of childcare where I live would mean that we’d be paying close to 4K additional a month. I’d be handing over my paycheck just to apply with that.

There are mornings I wish I would never wake up. I love my children but I feel like my anxiety and depression is detrimental. Sometimes i think they’d be better off with having someone else raise them.

I don’t know where to go with my marriage. I tell my husband how I feel, that Im anxious all the time. I My husband thinks it’s something I can do to change my state of feeling and I should be happy.

I’m worried about my kids futures. We live in a small apartment on the second floor. That means I’m hauling all 4 kids up and down two flights of stairs anytime I want to go out.

I try and take care of myself, go to the gym with the kids 5 days a week (there’s a daycare they can stay in for up to 2 hours, you better believe I use it)

We can’t afford help. My family is not able to help bc they don’t live near by. 

Is my marriage doomed? We have no savings. No life insurance. Drained my 401k when he was out of work. And now owe a shit ton of money to the IRS bc he “made too much”.

,Marriage,"Hello,

Two common advice about marriage are that you should be able to always be your genuine, authentic self around your partner, and that you should accommodate each other's needs. My question is, what is the boundary between those two? 

For example, one party likes to swear and the other hates to hear swear words and has asked his/her partner to not swear when they're together. The partner agreed to fulfill the request but after a while he/she feels too guarded in their conversations and cannot let him/herself go, hence not feeling like being his/her authentic self. This is not the best example, but I hope you know what I mean. 

One more example, one party is outspoken and the other is sensitive on particular issues, so the outspoken one tries to hold some of his/her opinions that could get his/her partner upset, but then feels like walking on eggshells.

We’re both active duty, and my husbands career field is known for being rowdy. Whenever he gets together with his friends (they all work together) he doesn’t know his limit. He lets them talk him into taking shot after shot, and doing “case races” (teams of two race to drink a 30pack the fastest.) it makes no sense to me why a grown man wants to get blackout drunk. A good deal of the guys are in their early twenties, so I understand them wanting to drink themselves stupid. But my husband is past that point in his life, yet can’t not get drunk when with friends. When at home he’ll drink a few beers a night, no big deal. The second he gets invited out, he comes home stumbling and slurring his words. I’ve expressed many times how this upsets me, but he continues to do it. It used to be every weekend, but is not a couple times a month. (However, I think it’s slowed down only due to the fact that we were having a rough patch six months ago.)

We plan on starting a family soon, and I just don’t want him acting like this with a child around. I drink maybe once every other month. I just don’t feel the need to drink, and don’t understand his want/need to do so. I’m perfectly fine with casual drinking, but do not understand the need to drink until you’re puking.

As a matter of fact, I sent him to bed tonight after picking him up from a friends, and he could barely walk straight. And he was only there for 2-3 hours. 

Am I being unreasonable? Is it normal for grown men to still drink like this? I’m truly lost, and it upsets me to the point of tears Everytime it happens. Doesn’t help that his co-workers will also “jokingly” text me asking permission for my husband to go out. Which I never restrict him from doing. I’m just lost and upset with what to do about it.

,Marriage,"I am not sure if this is right place to post, I apologize in advance. 

My husband and I’ve been married 2.5 years. No kids yet. When we first got married, I moved into his parents house. It created tremendously stress for me and we decided we needed our own space after six months. Well, his parents had a back house and that’s where we’ve been living. 

My current commute to work is one hour each way. That’s two or more hours sitting in traffic per day. So I decided to transfer to another location for my work which is only 15 min to/from my parents place. My parents recently bought a house and has five bedrooms. Two are empty right now and my mom wants us to move back home close to my new job. 

I spoke to my husband and he’s hesitant. He’s worried moving there will be too much commute for him. He has school in another city and it’s currently 28 miles. If we move to my parents, it goes down to 20 miles. And he’s also worried about work commute. It will be further than current commute from where we live (We live in LA so traffic is insane). And I also think he has another reason which he’s not telling me lol

So I decided to transfer to another location for my work which is only 15 min to/from my parents place. My parents recently bought a house and has five bedrooms. Two are empty right now and my mom wants us to move back home close to my new job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke to my husband and he’s hesitant. He’s worried moving there will be too much commute for him. He has school in another city and it’s currently 28 miles. If we move to my parents, it goes down to 20 miles. And he’s also worried about work commute. It will be further than current commute from where we live (We live in LA so traffic is insane). And I also think he has another reason which he’s not telling me lol &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to know if anyone has moved back to their parents as a married couple. Any insight on pros and cons will be wonderful! Financially it will be the same as we will still pay rent to my parents, but I will definitely save on gas.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks in advance to any insight on my situation. I've been married 9 years, have two boys 5 and 3 years old. We live a pretty charmed life in Vermont, from the outside think looks great.  But we are struggling and every day is feeling less hopefull for our marriage.

She says  years of resentment have built up and are coming to a head, she has put herself last and always put pressure on herself in her roles as a mother, wife, lover etc, and has never learned who she is. She has told me straight up that she wants to run, wants to have an affair, doesn't think she can be married because she doesn't know who she is. Next week she is going to a 5 day retreat that specializes in ""love avoidance"" 
This was her idea, shes knows she has an a lot of work to do on herself. I'm glad shes doing this program, but am not feeling hopefull that anything is going to change.

This was her idea, shes knows she has an a lot of work to do on herself. I&amp;#39;m glad shes doing this program, but am not feeling hopefull that anything is going to change. I still have a lot of love and affection for her, it&amp;#39;s been so hard to feel completely abandoned, and see her go through these changes. We have been seeing a therapist for over a year, being proactive, doing the work.I know that things often need to get worse before they can get better. But I have been preparing for the worse. Talk of separation have come up recently. I&amp;#39;m scared and lonely, crushed that she wants to have an affair. If anyone has had any similar experiences I&amp;#39;d like to hear hows things played out. And please dont sugar coat anything I need to know the reality of my situation.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"It seems like Reddit is the way to go, because I can’t trust anyone else to vent to about my marriage (family or friends who know me more than they know him) without being biased.

Social media seems to be a problem these days, and we allow it to happen. My husband (33) and I (23) are ten years apart. I see social media these days as a way for men to flirt and talk to other females behind their significant other’s back and to possibly cheat. I’ve been through some shit behind social media, but having a clear mind knowing my husband isn’t my past, I have to realize this isn’t going to be an issue unless it becomes an issue. 

I found out my husband has been deleting messages with other woman (female friends) on Instagram because he “knows how I’ll react.” This was about a week ago. I asked him in this context to keep messages on your phone, because how am I supposed to fix my insecurities when he’s hiding things? Now that I think about it, this could be from texting and other forms of social media. 

This past Friday, one of the girls from CrossFit and I were talking and she happened to strike up the conversation with, “Yeah, he messaged me saying he should’ve done the same workout as I did.” 
Cool, no big deal. 

Yesterday evening, we went out for a movie and it was a great night. I asked him in the context when we got home, “Can I ask you something without you getting upset? I’ve been having dreams the last couple of days with you involved with other woman. You aren’t hiding anything from me right?”

Him: In the context of not handling my statement. “Are you serious? Over a dream? No offense, but that’s kind of crazy for you to think.” 

I’m not saying dreams do come true, but damn, they hit hard. I never accused of him cheating nor talking to women behind my back. I let it go, and I moved on with the night. 

Today, I ask him to see his phone, pulled up Instagram in front of him, and what do I notice? No message between him and her. GREAT. 

His response was fairly unpleasant, “Is this why you’ve been in a bitchy mood today? You’ve been acting like a cunt.” 

Me: ”So again, for something that I had asked of you to not do and still deleting messages.” 

Him: In the context of, “Yeah, because you think I’m out here cheating on you. You’re having bad dreams and you’ll think I am cheating on you.”  

He then goes onto his computer gaming and isolating himself from me and canceling any plans we had today. Great. Another way to punish me it seems. 

As I’m leaving to do errands (because I’m not going to be cooked up in our apartment being ignored and crying my eyes out) I still tell him I’m leaving. He doesn’t turn around. He doesn’t say anything the first time. 

Me: “Did you hear me?” 

Him: “PEACE.” 

Okay. 

I grab my Starbucks coffee, head to the grocery store, and once again for the last two weekends, I’m buying a full shelf of food. (Last weekend was because he found out there was debt in collections and he paid it off from his account and for a whole week, I was taking care of any groceries/food we needed. Mind you, he gets housing and grocery allowance with the military. I don’t see any of that $$$. I don’t ask him for shit. I just get what we need and go home. We either go half and half or one pays full one time and the other pays full the next) 

I get to our complex, and I’ve already made two trips inside the apartment. No help. A third time, he doesn’t come out of our room. I’m finally in our place from the fourth trip storing away our groceries and cleaning up the kitchen. 

About an hour and a half later, I leave the bathroom from cleaning, and he goes in there to use the restroom. Cool. I go into the room before he takes his little ass old man nap and he tells me, “I’m just waiting for you to stop making so much fucking noise.” 

Me: “Don’t talk to me like that. I went out to get groceries—
He cuts me off.

“I don’t give a fuck.” 

Me: “Okay, not once did you come out and help me. You heard me go in and out and it wasn’t to piss you off.” 

Now I’m here typing up this long situation for strangers to read, because I feel:
•I don’t have an opinion without being bashed on.
•Even when I don’t curse him out or call him names or disrespect him in the sense of acting like he’s a piece of shit, it’s my fault because I mentioned about something I thought we agreed on (based off of my insecurities and guys, wouldn’t it just be a lot easier to leave messages there in case your lady does want to see something or have questions upon?) 
•Unappreciated (Sadly, of course I make much less. I’m a dependent. I don’t ask him for money. I don’t ask him share a checking account either to reach his funds. I do what I can (helping with utilities, paying my car note, my phone bill, groceries, going out to eat, dates...etc) with what I make. 

I have no idea how to act or how to overcome this situation. It happens many times when it comes to me expressing my feelings and then I just get lashed out at. Mind you, I’m his second wife. Mind you, all of his exes cheated on him, and I feel as if I get the shitty end of the stick by being ignored, getting called ugly names, being yelled at, and my acts of service meaning absolutely nothing when he’s upset. 

I’d rather tell him how I feel than to not treat him like a prince or to ignore him.

,Marriage,"Throwaway account because my partner uses Reddit and he knows my main. 

I (22F) met Alex (26M) three years ago at a restaurant we both worked at. We both liked each other, but thought the other one was unavailable for whatever reasons. We both got into long term, live in relationships that ended pretty badly. We reconnected about four months ago, and have been inseparable; I know he is the one. Point blank. He is sweet, and charming, and not without flaws, but even his flaws are a part of the whole package, and god damn do I like his package (pun intended, kids). I don’t mean to gush, but I feel so differently about him than I have anyone else. I do have quite a bit of experience dating, and this is by far the most healthy and mutually satisfying relationship I think either of us has had. We discuss having children together and what our lives could look like. We are moving in together next month, and both of us are thrilled and excited. 
I think we probably would have waited a bit longer to move in together, however I have been planning to move to another state for quite a while and Alex essentially has decided to follow me. So we decided to move into a mutual friend’s spare room in order to kind of “test run” being room mates, in preparation to move out of state together.

With this out of state move coming up, and the ongoing discussion regarding marriage/kids/finances/you name it, I want to commit to him. I want him to know that I’m in this forever. It’s a big gesture to propose, and he knows how much it means to me to be married. 

Both of us are kind of private and relaxed, we both value genuine gestures of romance that are meaningful to just us. I want to ask his mother, who I get along with, for her blessing. I also want to ask his childhood best friend for his blessing as well. Although outdated, I think it’s sweet to involve his family. I believe Alex values those external nods of approval as well. I have always found the proposal between Monica and Chandler in Friends to be romantic (SO basic, I know,  but it always suck with me; I don’t even like Friends LOL). I think that shortly before we move out of state together, I’d like to surprise him at home. Cover the entire apartment in candles, play our playlist (we have a playlist of songs that remind us of each other), dress up, get down on one knee and ask him to marry me. I would maybe have dinner and wine for him.... I feel like he’d be coming home from work. 

Anyway, my parents aren’t together anymore, and my mother died a few years ago. I don’t have many people to ask. So, here I am Reddit; what should I do? Does this sound reasonable? Women of reddit, did you ask your partner to marry you? How do I find his ring size?! Are there any other things I should do to propose? I’m freaking out in my head.

,Marriage,"My husband and I are newlyweds. I’ve been with him for a 2 years and we’ve been married for 3 months out of those. We have no kids together but he does have one from his previous relationship. For the first time I’m with someone who accepts me for myself and appreciates the care/love I give. Anyone’s ideal relationship up until the issues at hand... we are running into the same problems that creates the same arguments more often than necessary.

His side of the issue is that I’m never satisfied with and I don’t notice his efforts to change, he’s “not use to being with someone who actually cares about him” so it’s going to take adjustment, and that I’m always upset so he has to walk on eggshells to keep the peace.

I don’t want him to be uncomfortable to say or do things around me but I do want him to be more cognizant of his behavior and words because I am sensitive to it. I don’t want to continue to go out in public and be embarrassed by my husband because he doesn’t realize that he’s a jerk in front of others but an angel at home.

,Marriage,"Been married 8 years now together for close to 10 or so and there was times in the past when she's has up and left me for greener pastures or so she thought and I've always waited for her and have always been loyal during these ""off"" times. The past bunch of years I've been dealing with a crushed spine I'm on surgery number 4 and admit my being in pain has caused me to be a turd towards her. Now she has decided that it's that time again to ditch out using my lashing out at her as an excuse to take off. I admit my pain isn't her fault and I admit doing that to her was wrong. I'm having problems with how many chances I've given her between taking off for weeks and months to the other men shes been with in one way or another. I feel like I'm pointless and useless because I don't deserve the chance I've given her in the past or is she right that me being a turd to her when I'm in pain is just way worse then if I had cheated? I'm sad very sad and may have posted this in the wrong spot I'm sorry if that's the case. Her actions are really weighting hard on me like no sleep unpleasant thoughts from time to time.

,Marriage,"Apologies in advance if I accidentally break a rule, first time posting in this sub. I am 29m, my wife is 28f. We've been married for just over four years, and for the most part, it's been a pleasant marriage. Until recently. I'm what you would call a 'gamer', but just last night, I came to a realization that for the past few weeks, possibly a month or more, I've been prioritizing a favorite game of mine over us, and when the realization hit, it hit me \*hard\*. When I brought it up to her when I got home from work last night, my wife mentioned that she felt I was more married to my game than I was her, and this isn't the first time it's happened. I absolutely love my wife and will do anything I can to save us.

To give a little more background to our particular situation: she had a kid before we got married, but I absolutely adore this boy (even when he's a pain in the arse), and we had him for the week. The father lives on the other side of the state and has primary custody, so we have limited time to see him because of that. This has been the arrangement since mid-2017; we had to move due to job issues with me and not having anywhere else to go at the time. They're on their way back to take him back to his dad's, and we talked about all of this last night. She didn't explicitly say it was over, but did re-assure me that so long as I did what I needed to do to get back to ""us"", there was no issue.

So I'm doing just that. However, she's staying a week over, and my anxiety has kicked into overdrive due to past insecurities, i.e., saying 'it will be fine' only to have a drop out of nowhere. It's very easy for me to slip into the self-pity/self-loathing phase, and I know I'm there already because I feel like the absolute worst husband. My wife and stepson are the best thing that has ever happened to my life; I know I have a problem that needs to be dealt with, so I want to do everything in my power possible to save what's left.

Any advice any of you can give? Am I overreacting with the anxiety part? I don't want to lose the one person in my life that has stuck with me through thick and thin, but there's this nagging voice in my head saying it's already too late, and I don't know how to cope with this at the moment.

I find myself moving back and forth on a spectrum of responsibility. That may be the wrong word. On one end is complete self sacrifice  for the family unit. The slogan is, no matter what harm comes to me emotionally, I must stay in the marriage for the sake of the family unit.

On the other end is complete service to my self. The slogan is I must take care of myself foremost to be in the ideal position to be the best for my family and career. (This could be described as selfishness but not the negative type of short-term pleasure, but of holistic self care.)

I find myself wanting to commit to one end or the other, so I can go through accepting that new reality. However, I am afraid of the consequences of over-submitting to a narcessist or divorce and breaking up my kids' home.

Is this perspective I've developed simply unhealthy? I'd love to upgrade and find some clarity.

Witch means, you should work hard to stay in perfect physical shape, pay for all the dates, pay all the living expenses and you should not be too comfy where you talk about your personal life and emotions that has nothing to do with your woman and that doesn’t affect her.  You should keep your  family’s history private and if you have any sort of drama between you and your birth family then you shouldn’t talk about it in front of your wife or to your wife. You should not talk about private health issues or any of your families health issues because that is none of her business. You never know what your wife does when she is with her friends. She may be talking about you behind your back and gossiping so you never want to reveal any personal infos. You should never ask for sex. The reason why you hear so many stories of men complaining about not getting enough sex is because they are always desperate for it and often don’t pay attention to their wives mood. So never ask for sex. And never ask for affection or don’t suffocate her with touches or hugs because even tho her love language may be physical touch, she may not like being touch all the time. Your wife is not your property so you shouldn’t touch or kiss her without asking permission first. Ask permission before you touch or kiss her or just let her come to you when she wants. 
You should have your own life, hobbies and friends outside of marriage.

,Marriage,"Background, married 25 years, 3 kids, HS to collage, only one left at home.  She got a chronic illness 7 years ago, that lead to me breaking down trying to be super dad, husband, and caregiver about 4 years ago.  That made me admit to her how unhappy I had been in the marriage for many years.  I was a classic no more mister nice guy.  I was unhappy in the marriage, so I invested in more.  When she got sick, this went into overdrive till I collapsed.  So we started trying to redefine our marriage.  It has been rough to say the least.  She feels like the rug was pulled out from under her.  The marriage she thought was perfect was me being unhappy, so I put more in thinking if she was happy, then I could be too.  You can imagine, this created a place where she felt like a princess.  Constant validation, constant input of love from me.  This did not yield any real response, she was overwhelmed by kids (SAHM), her own depression, and horrible self concept.  To find out it was not good for me was a shock to her because I kept trying to lift her up.

Now today...This is where we are struggling.  She is yearning for this validation.  For me, in my head, I know she loves me wholeheartedly, like few in this world will ever know.  She is trying to reach out to me in the ways she knows how.  I want the relationship to work.  I love her.  However, I just can't seam to get my heart to agree. That makes the daily affirmations not something I feel, but a checklist item I do for her.  Because of this, I don't do them well.  They are hit or miss to say the least.  When I get home, due to her depression and negativity, I don't really want to spend time with her.  I do, but again, it is more of a chore I do to try and help my marriage.  In my head, I know this is the right thing to do, but in my heart, I don't want to.  

To me, this is something I had been trying to privately work on.  Kind of a normal slump that marriages go through as we go through life for that many years and that it would come back.  I kept trying to find that spark.  Unfortunately, in marriage counselling this week, the counsellor asked if this is how I have been feeling.  Called me out on it.  Hit the nail right on the head.  I did not want to admit that to my wife and so I tried to avoid it.  My wife immediately said, this is it, this is what she had been feeling was off in our marriage.  Now a week later, I admitted to my wife what is going on in my heart.  Tried to explain it to her as best I can, but I don't really understand it myself.  It pretty much destroyed her.  Our marriage has been the primary foundation of her life.  The last four years had shaken it, now with this, it has cracked severely.  I don't think beyond repair, and I think the honesty is necessary.  However, the only chance I have of fixing my marriage is to really double down on the affirmation and reaching out.  In my head, I know this is right and what I should want to do.  I don't want to loose my wife and family.  However, I cannot seam to get my heart to agree.  Not sure, maybe I feel a little blackmailed into it rather than coming from a place of love. I will do those things, try to fake it till I make it, keep trying to bring that spark back, but I just don't know how.  

How do I convince my heart to agree with my head.  How do I save my marriage?

I don&amp;#39;t think beyond repair, and I think the honesty is necessary.  However, the only chance I have of fixing my marriage is to really double down on the affirmation and reaching out.  In my head, I know this is right and what I should want to do.  I don&amp;#39;t want to loose my wife and family.  However, I cannot seam to get my heart to agree.  Not sure, maybe I feel a little blackmailed into it rather than coming from a place of love. I will do those things, try to fake it till I make it, keep trying to bring that spark back, but I just don&amp;#39;t know how.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I convince my heart to agree with my head.  How do I save my marriage?  She basically said either I figure it out and show her I love her, really invest heavily in our marriage, not in act, but with my heart, and within the next few weeks, or she is done.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Hey everyone,

First time sharing (via a text post) across all of Reddit so apologies for rookie mistakes. My (F29) husband (M28) has struggled on and off with depression and anxiety for probably most of his life, but takes it like a champ and copes with it well most days. This past year has taken a bit of a toll on him, and he has been having very low periods much more frequently. Today he went in for a mental health assessment (which I’m very proud of him for doing), so he’s getting help, but I’d like to know what I can do for him on a regular basis, especially during times he’s really struggling. We’ve learned a lot together as a couple about how to help each other, but I especially feel like I’m at a loss when he’s feeling exceptionally depressed, and for obvious reasons, he has a hard time explaining what he needs from me.

What do you do for your partner when they’re struggling with mental health, just to make their lives a little bit better easier? Also, how do you help your spouse when they’re feeling down and can’t get themselves to do anything, especially when you know it’s something they’ll regret not doing later (i.e. going to work, a going away party, etc)?

,Marriage,"I need some help about how to address a very serious difference of opinion between my wife of 16 months whom I love dearly and our marriage which I am trying to put my all of my weight into. We have had financial problems and today's battle was about keeping a joint budget. It came up rather innocuously when I was showing her Mint and as soon as she saw the pie chart she exploded.  I was blindsided by a layoff a year ago and haven't gotten stable work since. Worse, it took her nearly a year to get her work permit after not working for over a year already and with such a hiatus she still hasn't gotten a work as hard as she's tried and is living on savings (wiring small sums of money from Brazil) so her financial situation is also precarious. However, when times were less bleak I agreed to pay for nearly all of big expenses (mortgage, utilities, moving, and pretty much anything related to the house.) I have yet to suggest a change in this arrangement because I know she cannot afford to pay for any more of her part of the shared expenses then she already is. Meanwhile, I am out of cash and spiraling into debt. I have some great work prospects coming up, but if they fall through it's going to get ugly.

We already have also been getting into some serious fights that I have suggested we get counseling for because they seem to revolve around miscommunication and cultural differences, but our financial situation is clearly a massive problem as well. One issue is that she feels like the house being ""mine"" makes her feel like a ""guest"" but considering we cannot redecorate without money where she could help make it her own, it's not like we can do much. (I didn't  bring up that I was paying the bills because I am not that stupid but I don't think that spared me much of her wrath.) Basically she feels trapped and I get it, so when I suggested we make a combined budget using Mint she saw it as another encroachment of me taking away her personal space and/or freedom.

Her reaction was so sudden and severe that she accused me ""putting her on a leash"" or ""telling her how to spend her money"" among other terrible things that I never said or even implied. In fact, I said I had no interest in telling how she spent. I just needed to see what her bills looked like. She was insulted that I would think she didn't have handle on her own budget (which was never the issue) so even talking about ""why a budget in the first place"" was nearly impossible. She said all her life she never shared finances with a partner. (She only was serious with one, but I didn't say this, obviously.) I am confident that she she is being frugal with the little money she brings into the US, so it's not like I worry about her overspending. Honestly, I worry more about my own and wanted us both to be able to see what it really was costing us and how much we (sorry... *I*) was getting in debt. I know she helps with whatever she can but it's very hard to calculate how much with no real budget so I have no idea how much we are really spending. She says ""ask her if I want to know"" but when I did, she immediately told me no. I even suggested talking to a financial counselor and she basically told me ""fine, you can go by yourself.""I am seriously at a loss as to what to do. I am already overloaded thinking about paying bills month to month so this just makes me want to run into traffic. Having this informational blind spot that could be resolved with a simple act of sharing just adds to my stress level. She refuses to yield. I know I can be an ogre too, but I was going nowhere with this. Again, I think we should see a counsellor but after today I am actually afraid how she'd react to this, not that we can even afford it. I suppose if we can't even mediate our disagreements we are not meant to be, but this all seems do unnecessary. Clearly she has her point of view that I can't even fully fathom, but I feel like she is being hurtful. She even said that the debt from paying the mortgage and our other bills was ""my responsibility"" and even if she did get income she wouldn't help me with it. I simply didn't have the words for that.

I need some advice from someone who might help me salvage what was once true love but now feels like a dumpster fire. I feel that a woman reader could show me something that I am missing because clearly I am missing something. I would love to hear from a Latina who grew up in a traditional patriarchal family who can relate to the cultural divide going on here. I try to respect her feelings but it's gotten to the point where I don't feel that it's reciprocated in these kinds of situations. In case cases like this where it feels like it impedes basic life functions I have to think I am doing something very very wrong for her to be this way. I love her and I know she loves me, but we are both at our wits end and as much as I want to avoid this flying apart, if this keeps up it's going to. Even if I get a job (my prospects next week look very good) I worry about her not working and how much that bothers her. Furthermore, the core issues are not going to just go away. If I don't get them, I really need to just tell her we need to sell the house and go.

,Marriage,"Was going to begin by saying that I've been starting to question my marriage recently, but it's probably been close to two years now. We've been married for four years, and I feel so out of touch with what being satisfied should actually feel like. 

I have to preface this all by saying that I think my husband is a good man and a very loving father. I still find myself having wonderful and very engaging conversations with him, and we share many of the same values and goals. I know that I absolutely do love him in many ways.

All of that being said, I don't know if we bring out the best in each other. I think he has a tendency towards depression, which manifests in his being unmotivated in many aspects of his life. He does a small percentage of the housework, has been financially irresponsible over the years, does not take care of himself physically, and puts almost no effort into doing anything for our relationship that requires actual effort. He always enjoys our infrequent date nights, but never does anything to make them happen. I get very resentful of having to ask for help, and absolutely hate being a nag. I have told him this many times over the years, always when I am at a breaking point, and improvement never lasts more than a week or two.

I know marriage means compromise. And I know that unfortunately marriage often means having the same fight over and over again. I also feel like when I picture my life without him, it doesn't look great realistically. But every day I think about being in a relationship that challenges me to actually be a better version of myself, instead of the steward of someone else. My husband has made promises to go to therapy to deal with the issues that he openly admits he has, but it has never happened. When I brought up couples counseling at one point he begrudgingly agreed, but made it very clear he didn't want to do it. 

I honestly feel sometimes that he needs someone to push him, and I am just not the best partner for that. I am very self-motivated, but being confrontational and making someone else do something makes me so uncomfortable.

,Marriage," 

My husband (M29) and I (F28) have been going through a rough patch. I’ve had many doubts on whether I should stay or leave… He has cheated in the past, I haven’t. Though, you could say that I’ve cheated emotionally for the past few months because I’ve been talking (and am happy to do so) with another man who lives abroad.

He has ben incredibly jealous ever since and this is one of the reasons we’ve been fighting. He doesn’t want to forbid me to talk to my friend so now we have it out in the open. I’m not sexual with this guy, since he lives abroad but there is definitely chemistry so his assumptions aren’t completely in the wrong. Last night, my friend called me out of nowhere and per chance my husband saw me picking up. This shouldn’t be an issue, he said that I should just pick up when he calls and not act as if I have something to hide (which I don’t). But last night was the first time he heard me talking and just the “way that I talked” put him off extremely. It sounded “too nice” and “too much in love”… when it was my normal awkward phone voice. 

He went totally insane, went grunting in huffing in the shower. When I asked what was wrong, he hit me, through me on the bed and grabbed my throat. I was completely caught by surprise, since I didn’t feel I did anything wrong (?) and mostly asked him what was happening… 

Eventually, he let go of me and felt extremely guilty. I got mad, told him he was overreacting and he went to sleep somewhere else. I later came back to ask what his problem was and he apologized. I asked him to come to bed and we talked a bit. 

Frankly, I don’t really know what to do. My husband isn’t a violent guy. I never imagined he’d do this to me. It’s totally out of character, mostly since he has suffered a lot of abuse in his own childhood. We’ve been together for over 10 years. He has been dealing with severe depression (trauma), anxiety and abandonment issues. I know these are the sources of it outrage… though… I really don’t know how to look at this episode. I’m not scared, but I’m afraid I should be (?). 

What would you do in this instance? I love my husband and I want us to work, but I’m not sure if I’m ignoring an important sign.

The past 4 years my wife and I have been on very shakey grounds. She would threaten a divorce atleast once a month. We went the couples therapy and things were going good and  that's when our third one was conceived. But since our relationship has been in a steady crumble. I filed for divorce a 1 1/2 ago but backed out to work on us. She is one medal and going to therapy.  We've only had sex 4 times in the past 2 years. 

Until this past Tuesday our Anniversary.  Mind you we are going through a divorce still living together until court on the 17th. It was mind blowing sex probably the best in 8 years. We got to rekindle and talk and cuddle. As much as she has belittled me, ridiculed me, controlled me and told me to kill myself I have realized I am so in love with this women still. But I cant bare my heart with her, i am so sad. She wants to go to marriage counseling again and me to cancel the divorce. Courts in less then a week I'm $4500 in. I have the upper hand she makes 3x more than me she is going to have pay substantial child support and we are splitting the kids 50/50 which is sad also.

,Marriage,"My husband (M 33) and I (F 26) met to have sex. So the start of our relationship was very much fueled by attraction to one another. Now that we've been married a couple months (maybe that's why I'm looking at things so harshly) it feels like he doesn't want to have sex with me at all. Throughout the past few months, probably longer, I feel like I've had to beg him for sex. He rarely ever initiates anything with me anymore. It's usually me asking him to fuck and there are zero spontaneous acts. To top it off when he refuses, it makes me feel like having sex with me is a huge task. Most often he rejects me and says that he is too tired to have sex. Another layer of why I'm so unhappy is the fact that I actively know and have caught him watching porn and jacking off rather than having sex with me. He will say ""I'm hot"" and that I ""have a great body"" but he'd rather watch some other woman online. I just don't understand that. No matter how attractive I find myself not having my husband want to have sex with me seriously bruises my ego.

I've explained to him more than once that I would like to have sex more often than we currently do (it's not awful but it's maybe once a week - and again I have to initiate or ""beg"" him to have sex with me or I think it would go on much longer as a dry spell). He's obliged for only a short period of time or he acts as if I'm asking for too much when I tell him I want more sex. 

To complicate this, even more, he doesn't know that I know, but I went through his computer and found out that 4 months before we were married when I was away on a business trip he tried to find someone to invite to our condo to have sex with while I was gone. In one of the messages, he sent a woman he spoke about me basically not being able to provide for him all that he wants sexually. But he knows full well that I'm open to trying things because we've spoken on that very topic. It irritates me to think that he won't be open and honest with me despite me trying what feels like everything to please him. For example, around when he tried and did not successfully cheat he basically talked to me about opening up our relationship...probably mostly for his benefit so he could ""cheat"" with a clear conscience and he advertised it to me as an opportunity for me to explore more (he's 8 years older to me, has already been married once before and has been the 3rd for several couples). Now we've agreed to try it I feel like he's more excited to have sex with someone else than he is to share some experience with me. The problem for me here is that if he feels so strongly about trying this (he acts like he isn't but I know he is) then he needs to freaking understand that he cannot continue to be so lackadaisical about our sex life...but he just doesn't care or he's clueless, I have no freaking clue. Sorry, I'm just rambling now...

I feel a lot of betrayal, insecurity and it's difficult for me to trust him now knowing that he did try to cheat. I think this is why I've gone through several intense bouts of sadness recently.

,Marriage,"He’s going through a rough patch.  Since the start of my pregnancy, over 1 year ago, he started gaining weight.  He has always struggled with weight but enjoys dieting and exercising to a certain degree. But now he is in the obese BMI category. 

I kinda held on hope that he would be able to lose the weight and be motivated to get stuff done for himself but it’s not been the case.  Football season has now taken over our lives and every Monday/Sunday/Thursday is devoted to watching football and competing in his fantasy league.  I’m all for having a hobby, I have hobbies of my own but that’s a lot of time to spend watching TV and all he does is eat badly and drink beers on those days.

On the plus side, he’s a great father and does spend time on with caring for our 2 kids.  He does more than most men in my opinion.  And he’s not lazy, he helps around the house.

But I really dislike this unmotivated aspect of complaining about his weight, not doing anything about it and continuing to do things that don’t help in any way towards it.  He’s also grown out his hair for 9 months and refuses to get a haircut and it looks unprofessional and unkept.

Our relationship feels like it’s slipping into roommate mode.  We haven’t been on any romantic date in god knows how long.  Near to no romantic gestures from his end unless he wants sex.

Our sex life had always been robust but with the pregnancy and the new baby, thinks kinda slowed down.  I still made an effort during that time to do it 2x a month minimum.  

I want us to get back into the swing of things but he doesn’t seem interested in more sex and honestly neither am I at this point.  (Im sorry, I guess I’m a bit shallow but I just can’t get excited about someone who doesn’t care about themselves at all) I’m hoping he can get his motivation back and start caring about how he looks and about us as a couple.  Right now it’s all about the children and just surviving day to day. 

I’ve talked about it with him but he seems to avoid the discussion and keeps saying things will change that he hasn’t given up on himself but it really seems like he has.  I’m not his mommy and don’t feel the need to nag him to take care of his hair and his health.

He’s also grown out his hair for 9 months and refuses to get a haircut and it looks unprofessional and unkept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our relationship feels like it’s slipping into roommate mode.  We haven’t been on any romantic date in god knows how long.  Near to no romantic gestures from his end unless he wants sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our sex life had always been robust but with the pregnancy and the new baby, thinks kinda slowed down.  I still made an effort during that time to do it 2x a month minimum.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want us to get back into the swing of things but he doesn’t seem interested in more sex and honestly neither am I at this point.  (Im sorry, I guess I’m a bit shallow but I just can’t get excited about someone who doesn’t care about themselves at all) I’m hoping he can get his motivation back and start caring about how he looks and about us as a couple.  Right now it’s all about the children and just surviving day to day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked about it with him but he seems to avoid the discussion and keeps saying things will change that he hasn’t given up on himself but it really seems like he has.  I’m not his mommy and don’t feel the need to nag him to take care of his hair and his health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure where to go from here....&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Just as the title says. I've been married for 2 years. We've just had a son, first time parents.  As a lot of women,  I'm currently staying home and struggling.  I love my baby dearly, but find that taking care of a fussy baby all day, followed by endless laundry, cooking and overall housework, it is not rewarding. It's lonely beyond belief. My husband almost never asks how I'm doing.  

Tonight he spent all of ten minutes with our baby. Has no idea what I do all day. Doesn't believe me when I say he's been fussy. I do everything at night. Not once has he gotten up with him.  

We got into a huge fight.  I told him I need ""more out of the relationship."" We rarely spend any time together unless it's in front of the TV on our phones. I've been trying to get him to go into the next town over, 2 hours away to the mountains for months. For a day trip,  no overnight. His reaction? ""We'll go someday?"" Someday? !?! It's not something crazy expensive place like I'm planning a Europe trip or anything.  

Then there's the issue of my tire. I've had a shotty tire for close to a year. Every 2 days it needs air. I've watched my husband buy plants for the yard, weed, t-shirts,  a microwave door.... but if I bring up that I need a new tires he says ,""it's fine"" or he goes into a rant how I crashed my car 7 months ago. (Which I did. It's been fixed since) so I have a car with a crappy tire. And a microwave door is more important. 

Last night I wanted him to go with me to the park with the baby for a walk. I'm trying to lose my baby weight. Anyway he just says, ""work out here at home ""....we ended up , you guessed it.  Sitting in front of the TV. I put a movie on and had to keep pausing it because he kept going in and out of the room to smoke weed. 

I don't know. Is this what a marriage is? I feel like we're not in year 2, but year 10. It's like he can't stand me. If I bring up any of these issues in having,  I basically stand alone. ""You're a miserable human being "" or ""you're negative"" or ""you're looking for a fight."" 

It's very hard to watch him come home, kiss the dogs, then baby, plus he calls his mother EVERY day (a whole other post) I feel like I'm not priority. Clearly. 

During our argument today his go to insult is, ""go get on your social media and talk to someone "" indicating that I'm talking to other men. Its....exhausting.

,Marriage,"I have been married for 28 yrs.  I have 2 children, and I am not living with my wife. She wanted to be free.  I have given it to her and now she doesn't want to divorce. I never wanted to be married until I met her. I didn't want a separation. She has been, in my own opinion, trying to get away from me since before we got married.  She claims that it was a loneliness that she couldn't deal with. I no longer want to be married. I feel now as  if I was obligated to be married. Why do relationships need to be manipulated like that. Do we need to feel part of something bigger, or feel in control of more than ourselves to be able to feel some kind of happiness.

\- Every night after 8 pm he stops taking my calls and does not answer any texts. Sometime around 3 or 4 am he will text me some bull shit excuse, ""fell asleep on my desk,"" ""no signal"", "" going to grab my keys from the office"" etc.

When I ask where was he and why he didn't respond to my calls he will start screaming and yell at me calling me a ""psycho bitch."" When I ask if he was with another woman he will look at me, say ""you are crazy"" and literally give me an evil smirk and start laughing.  When I ask specific questions he will give nonsensical crazy answers and start laughing. He will then suddenly turn sharp and yell at me, ""GO TO BED AND LEAVE ME ALONE"" and crash on the couch.

&amp;#x200B;

\- When he gets home after midnight, he will sit outside in our car and play on his phone and call, I'm assuming, one of his multiple women. I go outside and ask him to come inside and he tells me to go away and that he doesn't want to see my face.

&amp;#x200B;

,Marriage,"My (28F) husband (30M) I have been together 7 years, married for about 8 months. The month after the wedding was the happiest I’ve ever been, we were both feeling the wedding high and were so full of hope and love.


Around month 3 however, things started getting really bad. We went to a therapist for a couple months and it seemed to help a bit but it was always temporary. We stopped going, as it didn’t seem to be helping and it was very expensive. My husband and I are now just so disconnected, it’s honestly shocking to me how bad it’s gotten so fast. I don’t know what to do.


My husband is a good decent person and I love him very much, but I have a lot of anger and resentment towards him. I feel like I’m not getting my needs met and as a result I’ve become this angry nag of a wife. It’s a thousand little things, but ultimately I feel like he’s not a partner to me but a roommate or a child. There’s no lying or infidelity or abuse, just this horrible feeling that I can’t rely on him because he lets me down so often. 


He just isn’t present and doesn’t participate in our lives. I pay the bills and budget, remember to give the dog his heartworm medication every month, plan the vacations, figure out how to pay for said vacations, remind him to schedule dentist’s appointments, replace the toilet paper rolls, buy body wash when we’re out (and throw out the empties), organize activities on weekends, change lightbulbs and batteries, vacuum (he doesn’t see dirt), plan where we’ll spend holidays, and the list goes on. I sometimes delegate things to him so I don’t have to do it all, but he often forgets or takes forever to do it (so I nag). He almost never takes the initiative, so I’m always asking and nagging for things. It just feels like I have all the responsibility for our day to day lives and for planning for you know, our future, and he’s just along for the ride.



I’ve confronted him but he responds defensively, telling me I’m wrong, talking about all these other things he’s done and questioning why he’s the only person that has to do these things. He’s obsessed with everything being 50/50 equal as if we were roommates, not married people supporting and building a life together. It’s exhausting and I feel like giving up. I’m just miserable. It really really sucks. 


I’ve noticed myself getting meaner, and caring less and less about his feelings and needs because of all this. This is not the person I want to be. I used to be a fun and carefree person, I used to try so hard and care so much, but I’m afraid that my dislike for him is going to be the end of our very short marriage.

,Marriage,"Long story short. I broke up with spouse 1.5 months ago for a few reasons. Communication, trust, her PTSD.  I also thought I needed to branch out sexually and explore new things since I felt I needed that experience too. Something I knew my spouse wouldn't do. After I told her I wanted a divorce,  I looked for swingers and hookups and made a few friends through OkCupid. I didnt want another relationship, just sex or a friend (one or the other cant be both). 

One was a girl who initially I just wanted casual meaningless sex with. She liked to graze my arms and hold hands publically. She said she just does it cause she likes to touch people, I guess I get it. I went along with it since she made it clear she doesn't want a relationship with me.

 It still felt wrong holding hands tho cause it wasnt my wife...so I kinda avoided this girl for a week or so. I then told her how it made me feel weird and she was totally cool not doing that anymore. I adopted a dog off of her. We became just friends over the last few weeks.  TO BE CLEAR, I didn't get to have sex with ANY of these people. They were prospects that turned into friends instead. I went to therapy a month ago and found I really messed up with my spouse over things and REALLY wanted to get my spouse back so I really worked on that and we have been better than ever since. Therapy has helped a lot. I also realized I only really am sexually attracted to my spouse, and no longer have desire to have sex with others since me and her are doing better. I bought her a new wedding ring and proposed to her.

I do still hang out with this other person. I even brought my spouse to meet her which she seemed uncomfortable but willing and polite. I also had my spouse meet the swinger couple after her work day, they were just helping us find a decent place.

&lt;p&gt;Calling the nurse help lines in a store going over every thing he purchased and the amounts I need to heal..&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"I (24F) have been married to my husband (27M) for 4 years. In the past 4 years, we have  had 1 lovely daughter, moved across the world, been through different jobs, PPD, and lots and lots of things. 

All in all, I'd say we're really solid, with some natural growing pains in our relationship. He's a wonderful man,  truly my best friend even if I think it's laughable how different we are.

I'm kind of wondering how to get a ""spark"" back in our relationship. We dated when we were teens, and there's something thrilling, and fun about dating and having that freedom to be spontaneous.

Now, it's way more difficult to be spontaneous, or even PLAN a time to go on a date with each other. He's working very very hard at his job, long hours. I'm working very very hard being a mom and keeping everything under control at home. I know we've both let love notes and things fall to the wayside.

,Marriage,"My wife and I have been in this dynamic for almost the entire 10 years we have been together with the exception of when she was pregnant and we were both very open and connected. Since giving birth \~3 years ago, and going back to work \~2.5 years ago she has gone downhill in terms mental health. Her anxiety has reached new heights and tends to cause her to create a lot of distance in our relationship. This is opposite of how it used to be -- where I was the anxious one creating distance. She constantly complains about how terrible she is treated at work -- yet refuses to change the situation. 

At home I have taken on the role of cook, housekeeper, grocery shopper, bill payer, pretty much everything so she doesn't need to worry or thing about anything remotely stressful.

I went through several years of medication, therapy, and rebuilding myself to be where I am today. I'm much stronger and much more open as a person and as a husband, but now I find my wife is withdrawing more and more. I was previously taking the stance of pursuit -- to let her know how much I love her, how much I miss her, how much I want to spend time with her, etc. The result was her just telling me how overwhelming it is and how much pressure it makes her feel. 

I know that we love each other deeply, but I also know she is withering away. She's always exhausted -- but does very little. She expends all of her energy just getting through the workday.

She started seeing a therapist at my request about two months ago. I'm assuming it is going OK, but she doesn't share the details with me.

I'm in therapy, too. Just to cope with the void I feel missing my partner. I'm really sad that things have gotten to this point. Any kind of push from me gets turned into how shes not good enough or how she just has nothing left to give.

It seems like any real prompt for her to participate in our marriage, emotionally or otherwise, is just a huge burden for her to the point she has asked me to find a physical outlet beyond the confines of our marriage -- which I will not be doing.

I've been playing the part of the pursuer for too long now and I've started to get to the point where it is causing me to get resentful and angry. I don't want to be that way. I want to stop before I emotionally shut down and close the door on her for good.

,Marriage,"My husband is suffering from depression and anxiety. I am suffering from PTSD, anhedonia, major depression, anxiety, and I have Aspergers. We both have therapist and take antidepressants. We have an age difference of ten years. I am 37, he is 27. Normally it isn't noticeable. However, I was his first real love. Which is worrisome to me, because I feel as though he would want to keep things going on matter how badly they get.

We hardly fight. But last night he insinuated that he was the only one who does housework. Of course I was expressing the same thing (I'm right, he does housework in one room). I obviously felt unheard, invalidated, and unappreciated. He said some other bad things. We've been together six years, married for three of those years. Nothing overtly abusive has happened, just long distance, he had a legal issue that he lied about for several years. I don't know if I can forgive him,lies are a big deal and normally a deal-breaker. I don't want him to touch me at all. At some point in our relationship, earlier before the lies- we were affectionate. I know we're both lonely. I don't know how we can fix this. I have been feeling like leaving. I always feel like this in a relationship. I get hurt by something someone does, I stay with them and my feelings for them die. Except now I have a 9 year old from a previous relationship. They are kinda close. But he isn't as good to my son as he should be. He is so moody, his default mode is to do something on his own, or try to spend time with me. Of course that means doing things that he likes, watching or playing games he likes.

,Marriage,"This may be a little lengthy, but I want to give a bit of a back story.

My husband was single handedly raised by his mother. He never knew his father, and both his grandparents died when he was younger. His mother was mentally challenged, and by the time he was about 18 she was in such financial trouble she decided to move to a city about 2 hours away to live with distant relatives. She left him in their house, which he found out a week later was actually condemned. I knew my husband at the time, and my mom and dad let him come live with us. There were obviously issues, but none we blame her for. She did the best she could do.

She lived with relatives for a few years, but then went to a nursing home. She had knee surgery, but ended up not healing well which led to her being in a wheel chair. We moved her back up to be closer and would visit when able. Visits, and even phone calls were hard, as at some point she would cry and be upset that she was in a nursing home, but we didn't have the ability to care for her any other way.

In December, we went to visit her on Christmas day, and she didn't seem herself at all. We asked a nurse who said she was her usual self beforehand, no medications had changed, and perhaps she was just tired. Just a day later, she was taken to the hospital as she had somehow fallen out of bed, and was confused.

The next few months were crazy, as she basically developed dementia, broke bones to them being unused and weak. It was pretty rough, especially for my husband. She passed away in April. We both grieved, and I tried to be as available to help my husband as possible, without being too much. Both my husband and I are laid back, reserved, and I knew he didn't want to talk about it much.

His birthday is coming up, and he was talking to a buddy who's mom is also struggling health wise. Grief came bubbling up, and he had tears in his eyes when he said his birthday won't be the same this year.

So, my question is, what ways, or what things could I do to help him through this? Neither of us have ever lost a person like this.

It was a good weekend. I highly suggest it to others. Some times you just need a day/weekend to relax and recharge.&lt;/p&gt;

My wife and I tease each other a lot and we compete in various small things throughout our marriage. One of the thing that we always fight and argue playfully about is whose hometown is better. Her hometown is obviously larger, cleaner and actually the capital city of my country while my hometown (the place she lives now) is crowded and full of traffic jam. 

So whenever we are driving in our car/motorcycle she always brought up how jam packed the traffic is and how awesome her hometown is while I put out various non-sensical arguments on how it's not a ""traffic jam"" and that people here are ""queueing up"" because it's an awesome place to be like people ""queueing up"" in a theme park.

,Marriage,"My wife is a wonderful person in many many ways. One thing that I really wish could be different is that she is never the first one to apologize or diffuse an argument. We usually get along very well but sometimes I feel like I'm walking on eggshells. It makes it hard to fully relax, especially after a very difficult/stressful day. I don't feel that my home is my safe haven away from the stress of the world. When I get home from a very difficult day at work (I work very long hours and have to keep working when I get home, and on weekends, it's a temporary stage), I can't fully unwind.

Example: tonight was an especially hard day at work, an important project went south and I've been stressed over it all day. I came home and my wife got home shortly after me. We started having dinner and then BAM, she misinterpreted something I said or how I meant it... or something like that... and got upset. I had to explain that that was not how I meant it and no I don't think (the thing she thought I meant). You know how that goes. After I explained that she just let it go. I normally would too, I don't know if I'm more on edge today or what, but I told her I didn't appreciate how she misinterpreted something totally innocent I said just to make conversation and I would appreciate an apology. She turned it around on me and proceeded to get upset again. After a few minutes I cut it off and walked away, there's no point and I don't have the energy/time/will to argue anymore. Just then I thought how amazing it would have been if she had just said ""oh I should have known you didn't mean that, I'm sorry."" Then I would have said ""it's ok, we all do it, I'm sorry I upset you."" And that would be it. But no, not with her, never ever would that happen. I always have to be the ""adult"" or ""bigger person"" and apologize first and say something supportive, then she usually reciprocates.

Will this ever get better, or will this marriage always be another job when I come home, where I am constantly the one keeping the peace if God forbid there's a misunderstanding or an accident (like when I sat in a chair and accidentally broke it a few months ago, she was upset and bitchy for the entire evening). Do I just have to demonstrate good behavior  without question and hope she picks up on it and starts doing it too sometimes? I admit I haven't always jumped to apologizing and diffusing, mostly because often times when I do she doesn't even apologize or take any ownership of her part in the argument, but just says ""ok"" and tries to let it go without doing so.

,Marriage,"Warning: might be a little long but I need to give background. Married 20 years last month. Generally, we're doing great. We have some communication issues but past counseling has helped us recognize it and deal. However, in August I ran up against a recurring problem I've had with my husband and he basically revealed his reasons for years of odd behvior that I was blaming myself for. Let me explain.

For years....literally, years.... this had been happening and I mostly stayed quiet as to not cause a scene or uncomfortable moment in front of friends or family. An example: Husband and I are sitting around breakfast reading the newspaper. I say, ""Oh look, Disney is opening a new Star Wars Land.""...and we go on to discuss the article or, just in general discuss the idea. Nothing monumental... and then, a day later we'll be hanging out with friends and a friend will say ""He, did you hear they are opening a Star Wars Land at Disney?"" and my husband will say ""No, what's that about?""...totally ignoring that we'd discussed this already.

It happened CONSTANTLY...  from health topics to movies to news about friends to news of the world... another example, I'd seen a TV show that mentioned that women shaving their pits and then using deoderant might influence the developement of breast cancer due to the location of lymph nodes. I mentioned this to my husband because I'd been looking at getting laser hair removal, to eliminate shaving my pits.... he basically said, ""Nah, I don't think that'd make a difference."" That's fine. But a week later at a family dinner, his aunt says ""Oh, shaving and then using deoderant and breast cancer blah blah blah....."" and husband immediately says ""OMG is that true? I haven't heard about that!!"" and I was left thinking....did we not JUST discuss this? Is he ignoring me to make some kind of point?

Again, we're talking basically biweekly occurances of this happenig over 20 years. Granted, some instances of this were just passing comments and not in-depth discussions....so I thought, maybe he just didn't hear me when we were driving to Costco and I mentioned a news story or something my mom told me on the phone. But more recently I just felt like he tuned me out when I spoke, or anything I said wasn't worth remembering. It was also things like, i'd see something online I thought he'd enjoy and I'd send the link to him (news articles or something on Amazon or Redbubble or a meme or whatever)...I'd ask if he saw it, he'd say yes, and then a week later somebody brings up the same thing and he's all ""Oh I never heard about that!"" 

In August at his birthday party... I'd had enough. It happend again ON THE SAME DAY. That morning while preparing for the party I talked to him about the newly-announced Obi-Wan series, and we discussed the time period and possible comic book storylines it could follow. Literally four hours later, our friend ""Mike"" said ""Did you hear about the Obi-Wan series?"" and my husband says ""No, what is it?""

I stopped dead in my tracks and said ""'Husband, we JUST TALKED ABOUT IT THIS MORNING."" He shrugged me off, but after we were away from the group I asked just what in the heck was going on. We just discussed the topic, and he's telling people he had no idea. Did he not remember us talking about it?  He told me ""I'm just making conversation.""

It all crashed in around me. I just stood there in the middle of the kitchen... dumbfounded... for 20 years I thought I was basically being ignored or easily forgotten about. Turns out, I was being purposefully discredited. ""Why would you do that?"" I asked. ""All these times, all these years... I thought you weren't listening to anything I said. I've been so mad when it happens."" He just shurgged and said, ""I thought you knew what I was doing."" I almost cried! ""WHY WOULD I ASSUME THAT IS WHAT YOU WERE DOING???"" I practically yelled. ""WHO EVEN \*\*DOES\*\* THAT? You can still have a conversation without denying that you already heard about somthing.""

Did I overreact? Does anyone else's spouse pretend they didn't know about a topic you've already discussed just to ""Make conversation"" with others?  Why on earth would I assume that THAT was what he's been doing for 20 years? WHY?

&lt;p&gt;It happened CONSTANTLY...  from health topics to movies to news about friends to news of the world... another example, I&amp;#39;d seen a TV show that mentioned that women shaving their pits and then using deoderant might influence the developement of breast cancer due to the location of lymph nodes. I mentioned this to my husband because I&amp;#39;d been looking at getting laser hair removal, to eliminate shaving my pits.... he basically said, &amp;quot;Nah, I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;d make a difference.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s fine. But a week later at a family dinner, his aunt says &amp;quot;Oh, shaving and then using deoderant and breast cancer blah blah blah.....&amp;quot; and husband immediately says &amp;quot;OMG is that true? I haven&amp;#39;t heard about that!!&amp;quot; and I was left thinking....did we not JUST discuss this? Is he ignoring me to make some kind of point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, we&amp;#39;re talking basically biweekly occurances of this happenig over 20 years. Granted, some instances of this were just passing comments and not in-depth discussions....so I thought, maybe he just didn&amp;#39;t hear me when we were driving to Costco and I mentioned a news story or something my mom told me on the phone. But more recently I just felt like he tuned me out when I spoke, or anything I said wasn&amp;#39;t worth remembering. It was also things like, i&amp;#39;d see something online I thought he&amp;#39;d enjoy and I&amp;#39;d send the link to him (news articles or something on Amazon or Redbubble or a meme or whatever)...I&amp;#39;d ask if he saw it, he&amp;#39;d say yes, and then a week later somebody brings up the same thing and he&amp;#39;s all &amp;quot;Oh I never heard about that!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August at his birthday party... I&amp;#39;d had enough. It happend again ON THE SAME DAY. That morning while preparing for the party I talked to him about the newly-announced Obi-Wan series, and we discussed the time period and possible comic book storylines it could follow. Literally four hours later, our friend &amp;quot;Mike&amp;quot; said &amp;quot;Did you hear about the Obi-Wan series?&amp;quot; and my husband says &amp;quot;No, what is it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped dead in my tracks and said &amp;quot;&amp;#39;Husband, we JUST TALKED ABOUT IT THIS MORNING.&amp;quot; He shrugged me off, but after we were away from the group I asked just what in the heck was going on. We just discussed the topic, and he&amp;#39;s telling people he had no idea. Did he not remember us talking about it?  He told me &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just making conversation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all crashed in around me. I just stood there in the middle of the kitchen... dumbfounded... for 20 years I thought I was basically being ignored or easily forgotten about. Turns out, I was being purposefully discredited. &amp;quot;Why would you do that?&amp;quot; I asked. &amp;quot;All these times, all these years... I thought you weren&amp;#39;t listening to anything I said. I&amp;#39;ve been so mad when it happens.&amp;quot; He just shurgged and said, &amp;quot;I thought you knew what I was doing.&amp;quot; I almost cried! &amp;quot;WHY WOULD I ASSUME THAT IS WHAT YOU WERE DOING???&amp;quot; I practically yelled. &amp;quot;WHO EVEN **DOES** THAT? You can still have a conversation without denying that you already heard about somthing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I overreact? Does anyone else&amp;#39;s spouse pretend they didn&amp;#39;t know about a topic you&amp;#39;ve already discussed just to &amp;quot;Make conversation&amp;quot; with others?  Why on earth would I assume that THAT was what he&amp;#39;s been doing for 20 years? WHY? When I type it all out it seems so trivial but this has really scrambled my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Ive known my GF for about two years now. We talked for 7 months via emails and text before meeting up in person. The first time we met up it wasn't for a relationship it was because she was visiting my area and needed a guide. I passed over her ad on the dating site because 1. I wasn't interested in short term 2. I wasn't interested in a long distance relationship. Im glad I went back to message her. We found out we had a lot in common. Movies, video games, sense of humor, reading habits, tv shows, etc. After her first tripped we talked about how to make a relationship work. It got off to a bumpy start with some miscommunicated expectations but it got back on track pretty fast. I paid for her to visit me again 3 months later. That trip ironed out relationship expectations, she left again, and then surprised me 4 months later with a month long visit where I took her on a vacation to one of my favorite childhood spots. We had a blast. After she left that time I talked with her friend about surprising her by visiting her country. I worked it out perfectly. I would land in europe on the day of her birthday, the friend would pick me up, and we would surprise her with a lunch time party. I got to see her life in her country. It was everything she ever said and talked about. We stayed at her place instead of mine this time. It was a great 3 weeks living with her.

And I hated to leave her country and come back home without her. Since then we have talked about getting married. I was with another woman for 5 years before breaking it off and being single for another 5 years and meeting my now GF. There was a small time I saw myself getting married to that ex but that didnt last. That was young romance at best, a bit of lust at worst. She didnt support me and I took care of her. With my current GF she supports me, I support her. We work together. We talk out our problems. If we cant help each other because of the distance we still listen to issues and validate each others feelings. Theres a language and cultural barrier but we do our best to work around it. Her friends talk to me if they are concerned about her so that I may help her as well and I talk with them to help her where I cannot. I had a chance to hang out with her friends when I visited and they are all nice and caring.

Ive also looked at the little things she does.

She was a smoker for 15+ years. After our first meeting she switched to vaping because I hated the smell of cigarette smoke. 

She lost a lot of weight. I never expressed in any way that she needed to or would look better if she lost weight. She feels she has to do this for me even if I talk her out of it.

She has left her Heroes of the Storm and World of Warcraft European accounts in favor of playing on North American accounts with me. She had everything in Heroes of the Storm and started over just to play with me. She has mounts she cant get again on her EU WoW account that she left to start all the way over. She has to grind things out all over again to get back there. And she did it for me/us. As a gamer, thats a huge sacrifice right there. She could come back to them but she would need to do some of the stuff all over again and buy more game time to do it. 

If I have a problem with people/work she talks to me about it and supports me. 

We spend the majority of our saturday and sunday gaming and webcam chatting so we feel like we are together in some way.

When she visited me, I did all the driving. She insisted on paying me back so she doesn't waste my money. I told her not to worry and she can pay me back when I visited her. She drove me around quite a bit when I visited her country. Both times there was no awkward silence in the car. We drove for 2-3 hours on some mini trips and hardly spoke. Not because we had nothing to say, but because we didn't need to say anything. On one trip we drove back all she wanted was to rest her hand on my leg while we listened to music. And this wasnt limited to driving. We were in a snowstorm due to bad weather. I played video games on my switch, she played video games on my computer. It didn't feel like we were ignoring each other while playing in the same room and it felt right to be able to do separate things while still being in the same room. The same thing happened at her apartment. She watched TV, I spent time reading, curled up next to each other. It was great.

The sex is good too. She was willing to try a few things I like. I wont go into details. She surprised me on one of our trips by bringing something along I liked that I didnt think of asking for her to bring. 

When we talk about things its not an ""I/me"" or a ""her/you"", its an ""us/we"" conversation. 

She helped out around the house when she visited me. I helped out around her apartment when I visited her. This was not communicated as an expectation by either of us. It was just done. 

Ive been looking at porn from a very young age. I looked at it when I was with my last girlfriend and didnt have a problem with it. Hell I would look at porn after sex because I felt so unsatisfied with it. When my current GF stayed with me several times I didn't even load up porn sites. I haven't seen her since early June and Im hardly looking at porn. I dont want to look at porn because its not her. I have had problems getting erections in the past. As a guy we lose our ""ability"" to have random erections as we get older. I thought I lost that. However if I think about my GF visiting those come back pretty fast. 

Ive bought her a ticket (she doesnt know my reddit name) to visit me in a few months. I get overjoyed at the thought of seeing her again. Not because Ill be having sex. But because Ill be with her. I know we will talk about the future and working on getting things sorted out to get married soon. As she doesn't know about the ticket, she mentions that we wont see each other again this year but maybe in January or February. Assuming that shes up for it, she will be getting on a plane in less then 20 days to be here and see me. Ill tell her on sunday. 

Ive had friends and family talk to me the first time she was over about getting married to her as she could just be after my money. I can understand their thought process during the first meeting. Ive watched her closely and all Ive seen is the exact opposite. Ive seen her have a breakdown when things dont go well. Ive seen her get rightfully angry at me, anger because I did something stupid that hurt her that I regret doing. Ive watched her be remorseful when she thought she did something wrong to me. Ive seen her have a bad day and how I my sense of humor, jokes, kindness, and patience can turn that around for her. Ive watched her genuinely laugh like an idiot at my jokes, getting red in the face and laughing for several minutes at a joke. Shes made me laugh like an idiot as well. And when we take jokes to far we can tell before the other says something and we are able to fix it.

On one of the trips I took her on I got my car stuck in the sand a good way away from the main road. She didnt yell at me or call me an idiot. She jumped out of the car and started digging out the tires with her bare hands. The only thing she yelled at me during that time was to go run up to a guy with a big truck who was towing someone else out of the sand and ask for his help while she kept digging. After we were done she told me I need to be more careful and not to be such an idiot. She didnt yell at me for it. I bought her an ice cream afterwards for helping out and being level headed. 

Theres more. I either cant put it in words because its flying around in my head in a jumbled mess of emotions or I cant put it in words because its private. But I can see myself having having years of fun with her. We both have talked about the same thing, how when writing back and forth even before we met it felt so close like we were made for each other. We both dont want a big wedding or fancy rings because theres better things to spend money on. As long as *we* know that its true. I told her I dont like wearing rings at all. She doesn't care if I wear a ring or not as long as I am faithful to her. She has said several times she doesn't want me to change. She wants me for me. I have never asked her to change as I like her for who she is. Shes told me what she wants out of a living situation, a room that she can have as an office for her 3d modeling/design that will be hers to work on. Ive told her I want a garden thats mostly mine. We both want a yard for a dog. Its these small things that we talk about before hand.

Its looking good.

Im not looking for anything from this post other then to get it out and tell someone because Im excited. Outside of a few of her friends most people dont know about this.

,Marriage,"TLDR; How do you manage your spouse having friends of the opposite sex? Am I (32F) crazy?

My fiancé (33M) has a group of best friends from college (both men and women) that he has remained really close with over the past 10+ years. I’ve met each of them a handful of times and it’s so obvious how much they care for one another that I feel really thankful to have them in our lives. 

One of them though makes me feel a little uncomfortable with some of the comments she makes sometimes. I try to look at it through the lens of a brother/sister type relationship (though they did have an intimate relationship when they were much much younger) but even still it makes me feel like she doesn’t respect our relationship. 

An example: she mentioned she would be traveling, offer to split the cost for him to come and had a hotel room for 2 (he, of course, didn’t accept); she regularly responds to messages with hearts or kissy faces (which I actually think is a cultural norm, but nonetheless bothers me); and she has made comments about hoping he actually knows me well enough to commit to me...

In my mind, it is common sense that someone in a committed relationship wouldn’t share a hotel room with someone of the opposite sex but am I being close minded?

My fiancé really does everything humanly possible to make me feel secure about anything I bring to him (which is a big part of the reason I adore him) but I worry I’m never going to be able to accept their friendship. 

I guess I’m just looking for opinions/advice/two cents on whether I’m overreacting or experiences from people that have had similar situations and how you’ve managed them.",t2_4qtge10o,False,,0,False,Opposite sex friendships in marriage,[],r/Marriage,False,6,,0,,False,t3_deeju3,False,dark,,public,49,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,49,,self,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1570451097.0,text,6,,text,self.Marriage,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR; How do you manage your spouse having friends of the opposite sex? Am I (32F) crazy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fiancé (33M) has a group of best friends from college (both men and women) that he has remained really close with over the past 10+ years. I’ve met each of them a handful of times and it’s so obvious how much they care for one another that I feel really thankful to have them in our lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them though makes me feel a little uncomfortable with some of the comments she makes sometimes. I try to look at it through the lens of a brother/sister type relationship (though they did have an intimate relationship when they were much much younger) but even still it makes me feel like she doesn’t respect our relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example: she mentioned she would be traveling, offer to split the cost for him to come and had a hotel room for 2 (he, of course, didn’t accept); she regularly responds to messages with hearts or kissy faces (which I actually think is a cultural norm, but nonetheless bothers me); and she has made comments about hoping he actually knows me well enough to commit to me...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind, it is common sense that someone in a committed relationship wouldn’t share a hotel room with someone of the opposite sex but am I being close minded? I trust him with my life and think even if they did share a hotel room, nothing would come of it but it infuriates me that she thinks it’s okay to ask...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fiancé really does everything humanly possible to make me feel secure about anything I bring to him (which is a big part of the reason I adore him) but I worry I’m never going to be able to accept their friendship. &lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"I don't really know where to begin to be honest.  My wife (28 female)  and I (28 male) have been married for almost 8 years now, we have 1 child together and another one on the way due in March.  

I am currently in the Navy (8 years) and have a weird schedule where I'm gone for work Monday-Thursday and home only for the weekends.  I would say that our marriage has been pretty strong up until these last few years since being at this new command.  The time apart and raising children has taken a toll on us.  Since me being gone a lot and having limited connectivity for communication with my family I have done my best to deal with it and communicate things to her.  Where I work I have a lot of downtime and *used* to hang out with friends during the week and have social gatherings after work.  Some of those social gatherings would have girls there and we would play beer pong.  

I will be fully honest on here, I had spoken with one of the girls that I played beer pong with a few times on social media (to be 100% it was nothing more than a friendship between her and I) and I never told my wife about it until she saw her show up on my Facebook Messenger.  The messages were nothing more than friendly and professional but I completely understand how it would make my wife feel.  We had a huge argument over it and I agreed that I would delete my social media and tell her any time I had a run-in with her at work.  

I am telling you all of this because of that event a lot of our problems had stemmed from that.   I am not perfect and don't claim to be this saint, I know what I did was wrong and I am fighting to regain my wife's' trust back.  I am not home a lot and I try and do the best I can to alleviate a lot of the stress she has but I feel as if I am constantly getting my ""nose rubbed in the shit"".  We are in marriage counseling (even before the event) and I still feel like I am being backed into a corner.  I do love my wife but I feel that she will never have that grudge lifted off her shoulders and fully trust again.

She says I am the one that is the root of all of her stress and that I don't do anything to help out around the house.  I feel the exact opposite of how she feels, we have these senseless arguments of how she says I don't help or do this or I don't do that but I just don't see it.  I FEEL as if I am doing the best I can to help raise our son and be the best husband but I just feel that her expectations of what I am supposed to be are way too high and that I will never be able to please her.  She says that I am not the man she fell in love with and that I have changed.  There are some things that I forget to do around the house and yes she has to remind me but I do get the stuff done and later on get chastised for it because she had to tell me.  I just feel that I am being backed into a corner and have nothing to fight with and just have to keep my tail between my legs and can't speak my mind otherwise I am the one to blame for everything.

I am just lost... I don't know what else to do to try and reason with her.  I seriously FEEL that I am doing the best I can when I am home to help out.  We have tried talking one on one about this stuff but it ends going nowhere and she says that I can never understand where she is coming from.  I do cherish my wife for everything she does while I am away but I feel that I am just a visitor in my own home and in her life...

P.S.  My mother recently came to visit for a week and I had set up a whole afternoon date with my wife and I.  My mom agreed to babysit our son while we went on our date, it was really nice we went to brunch and then a movie after, it was our first date since having our son.  Even after doing all this my wife still says I don't do anything for her and am selfish.    

Any advice would help. 

Thank you.

Some of those social gatherings would have girls there and we would play beer pong.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be fully honest on here, I had spoken with one of the girls that I played beer pong with a few times on social media (to be 100% it was nothing more than a friendship between her and I) and I never told my wife about it until she saw her show up on my Facebook Messenger.  The messages were nothing more than friendly and professional but I completely understand how it would make my wife feel.  We had a huge argument over it and I agreed that I would delete my social media and tell her any time I had a run-in with her at work.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am telling you all of this because of that event a lot of our problems had stemmed from that.   I am not perfect and don&amp;#39;t claim to be this saint, I know what I did was wrong and I am fighting to regain my wife&amp;#39;s&amp;#39; trust back.  I am not home a lot and I try and do the best I can to alleviate a lot of the stress she has but I feel as if I am constantly getting my &amp;quot;nose rubbed in the shit&amp;quot;.  We are in marriage counseling (even before the event) and I still feel like I am being backed into a corner.  I do love my wife but I feel that she will never have that grudge lifted off her shoulders and fully trust again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says I am the one that is the root of all of her stress and that I don&amp;#39;t do anything to help out around the house.  I feel the exact opposite of how she feels, we have these senseless arguments of how she says I don&amp;#39;t help or do this or I don&amp;#39;t do that but I just don&amp;#39;t see it.  I FEEL as if I am doing the best I can to help raise our son and be the best husband but I just feel that her expectations of what I am supposed to be are way too high and that I will never be able to please her.  She says that I am not the man she fell in love with and that I have changed.  There are some things that I forget to do around the house and yes she has to remind me but I do get the stuff done and later on get chastised for it because she had to tell me.  I just feel that I am being backed into a corner and have nothing to fight with and just have to keep my tail between my legs and can&amp;#39;t speak my mind otherwise I am the one to blame for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am just lost... I don&amp;#39;t know what else to do to try and reason with her.  I seriously FEEL that I am doing the best I can when I am home to help out.  We have tried talking one on one about this stuff but it ends going nowhere and she says that I can never understand where she is coming from.  I do cherish my wife for everything she does while I am away but I feel that I am just a visitor in my own home and in her life...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.  My mother recently came to visit for a week and I had set up a whole afternoon date with my wife and I.  My mom agreed to babysit our son while we went on our date, it was really nice we went to brunch and then a movie after, it was our first date since having our son.  Even after doing all this my wife still says I don&amp;#39;t do anything for her and am selfish.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice would help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Hey peoples. Long rant about sex ahead. 


I have been with my husband for about 3.5 years, and we have been married for the past year and a half. Our sex life was great...until we got married. We went from sex 2-3 times per week down to once. Then we both started taking anti depressants (both on Lexapro) and now NEITHER of us want sex, like hardly ever. 


I think I am most bothered that I hardly ever feel in the mood to have sex. The other day I had just gotten out of the tub, and I found myself scurrying to the bedroom so my husband wouldn’t see me naked! I didn’t want him seeing me to turn into something sexual. WTF?!

I was raised to believe that you had to be a virgin until your wedding night or else you’d have a terrible sex life. That doesn’t mean I didn’t do other things prior to my first time having sex, I actually had an extremely high libido that I felt like I was constantly fighting against because of my Christian beliefs. 


I have since denounced these beliefs, but now my sex drive has dried up (literally-hah!). Part of me feels like I’m being punished, even though I cognitively know that isn’t true. I have been to therapy and have done a lot of healing work but now I’m just left holding the broken pieces in place.


Also, side note: I am stimulated by intensity and novelty, and my husband likes routine and predictability. I felt safe when my husband and I had sex for the first time. I wasn’t afraid he’d leave me, which is often what triggered my anxiety with sexual experiences before him.

,Marriage,"First time poster. I (26f) have been married to my husband (26m) for 4 months; together for 3 years. We’ve lived together for 2. 

He is in law enforcement and has been since we met. He has always had difficulty expressing emotions, and showing affection. I blame this mostly on the character of his job, and I know he has to act detached during work to simply stay safe.  I’ve always been mildly okay his lack of affection, and I’ve always attempted to understand that our love languages are different. 

But ever since we got married, his lack of affection has either A) gotten worse or B) I’m just noticing/feeling it more. 

I’ve tried multiple times to bring this up and discuss, I tell him I need more attention, I tell him that I’m feeling a little lonely sometimes, and he promises he will do better. I feel as if I’m having these conversations biweekly at this point, and nothing is changing. 

I tell him that I want him to compliment me sometimes (I honestly cannot remember the last genuine compliment he’s given me), I tell him I want him to start asking about MY day (instead of me always asking about his), I want him to invest and listen to my daily stories, just like I do his. I just feel like he’s so checked out of my life. 

Last week, we finally had a (what I thought) was a break through conversation. He admitted to me that his work is just draining him and when he gets home he doesn’t feel like he has that much to give. I was so glad he admitted this and made me feel less crazy. So fast forward to this past weekend, we were in our best friends wedding. I was super excited to share this experience with him, and get to enjoy each other and have a refresher. Well, weekend didn’t go as expected. As a bridesmaid in the wedding, I had my hair and make up professionally done, and once I was all dressed up I was excited to send him a pic. So I did. There was no response from him after I sent it. He opened it and didn’t respond. So this hurt me. When I saw him for the first time at the wedding ceremony, he didn’t hug me, tell me I looked good (I told him he did), and he acted very checked out. Throughout the reception,I was dancing, having a blast, and he would not dance with me. He slow danced to one song but this was it. He was so unattached to me, that some of our mutual Male friends even made it a point to say something to him and encourage him to come have fun and be present with me. 

Y’all, what do I do? I love this man. He’s my best friend. I feel like I’m bringing up our issues every other week to him and he doesn’t care. I simply feel that we are not emotionally connected. I don’t want to keep on like this. I don’t want to keep being sad or having my feelings hurt during milestones such as our friends weddings. I want to do life with him, and experience everything with him. Sometimes I feel like he could care less? I don’t know. 

This week was the first week I’ve considered going to see a therapist with him. Maybe just to help us learn how to communicate, I don’t know. I don’t even feel like he’d be open to the idea. 

Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do?

I just feel like he’s so checked out of my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, we finally had a (what I thought) was a break through conversation. He admitted to me that his work is just draining him and when he gets home he doesn’t feel like he has that much to give. I was so glad he admitted this and made me feel less crazy. So fast forward to this past weekend, we were in our best friends wedding. I was super excited to share this experience with him, and get to enjoy each other and have a refresher. Well, weekend didn’t go as expected. As a bridesmaid in the wedding, I had my hair and make up professionally done, and once I was all dressed up I was excited to send him a pic. So I did. There was no response from him after I sent it. He opened it and didn’t respond. So this hurt me. When I saw him for the first time at the wedding ceremony, he didn’t hug me, tell me I looked good (I told him he did), and he acted very checked out. Throughout the reception,I was dancing, having a blast, and he would not dance with me. He slow danced to one song but this was it. He was so unattached to me, that some of our mutual Male friends even made it a point to say something to him and encourage him to come have fun and be present with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y’all, what do I do? I love this man. He’s my best friend. I feel like I’m bringing up our issues every other week to him and he doesn’t care. I simply feel that we are not emotionally connected. I don’t want to keep on like this. I don’t want to keep being sad or having my feelings hurt during milestones such as our friends weddings. I want to do life with him, and experience everything with him. Sometimes I feel like he could care less? I don’t know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was the first week I’ve considered going to see a therapist with him. Maybe just to help us learn how to communicate, I don’t know. I don’t even feel like he’d be open to the idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do? It probably seems as if our problems are small, or petty, but the lack of emotional connection/attention is affecting me, and I need both.&lt;/p&gt;

My father in law has an alcohol problem. I knew this before I got married but did not know the extent until he harmed our dog at a party where he was the only person drinking.

My husband and I were so upset about this. He felt embarrassed, I felt scared. He put up big boundaries with his family and we did not see them regularly for years, partly because my mother in law (who does not drink) was always needy and had some sort of expectation on us to sort out her marriage problems.
My father in law apologised for what he did to the dog a few months later...over a beer.

Fast forward several years. We had a baby and we put up big boundaries with drinking around her, as we want her to have a relationship with her grandparents.
Things were better, we knew my father in law still drank, but he was not drunk around us.

Last night there was a big party as my brother in law got married. I knew lots of people would be drinking so I sent my daughter home early with the babysitter. 

At about 8pm, I was talking to my mother in law and I felt someone brush up against my body from behind, touching my bum. I thought it was my husband and turned but it was my father in law. He tried to kiss me on the mouth saying he loves me and if I had not turned my head away fast enough the kiss would not have landed on my cheek.  

My husband did not see this, but he saw his dad’s other drunk behaviour, and was very upset. He cried all the way home and I felt so sad. 

I have not been able to tell my husband about this as I feel scared to upset him more. I don’t want him to hate his father, or feel more ashamed or embarrassed.

,Marriage,"A little background: I (34) have been married to my wife (33) for about 4 years now. We have had our ups and downs, but a lot of it was either because of dumb things or miscommunications.  We are living in Wisconsin.  I work as an engineer and recently my wife decided to start working for a sports bar.  She has been working approximately 5pm to close (at least that is what she has on her schedule she sends me) about 4-5 days of the week.  In the past and even till now we have been relatively open with our phones (shared the password or fingerprint) so either one of us could get into each other's devices for whatever reason.  I'm not normally one to snoop in purses/phones/accounts etc as I have not had a legitimate need or had any suspicion, but after she started at the bar (about 4+ months ago) she makes casual mention about being groped in the bar and she has also been hanging out a lot of new women and men without me being there.  She also has been rather protective and paranoid that me being at her work (where she hangs out after shift) is causing drama or going to get her fired...which I don't know, but seems odd.  She takes home a fair amount of cash at the end of the night, which seems like a lot for the position that she is in (waitstaff).  There has been some questionable comments that she has made along the way when she is drunk that piqued my paranoia a bit; I went and looked at her phone and found WhatsApp on there with a single contact and messages.  In it was a conversation that went:

guy:&lt;some background texting&gt;

wife: Ok. Spoiler Alert... I'm not wearing any underwear. &lt;kissy face emoji&gt;

guy. Oo la la. Wud be fun. Where can I lick u?

wife: I'm heading over to &lt;another bar near our house&gt;. See ya when u get there &lt;kissy face emoji&gt;

guy: Got stuck at work. :( Sorry lets plan some other time.

I asked her what this guy was to her... because like WTF?!  She said that she flirts with the customers and that is how she gets such big tips from them and that she is loyal and would never actually act on anything.  Said that he is married and has a 1 yo kid and that they switched to WhatsApp because his wife was suspicious that he was messing around on her.  I feel that this is not right (what he is doing or what she is doing) and I told her that I'm sure any married couple that I knew would not find this kind of thing acceptable even if it was just ""part of the industry"" and made better tips and that it would not actually go any further than that.  At the very minimum it seems like she is setting herself up to get assaulted or give some guy the wrong impression and have things blow up.

We have had our ups and downs, but a lot of it was either because of dumb things or miscommunications.  We are living in Wisconsin.  I work as an engineer and recently my wife decided to start working for a sports bar.  She has been working approximately 5pm to close (at least that is what she has on her schedule she sends me) about 4-5 days of the week.  In the past and even till now we have been relatively open with our phones (shared the password or fingerprint) so either one of us could get into each other&amp;#39;s devices for whatever reason.  I&amp;#39;m not normally one to snoop in purses/phones/accounts etc as I have not had a legitimate need or had any suspicion, but after she started at the bar (about 4+ months ago) she makes casual mention about being groped in the bar and she has also been hanging out a lot of new women and men without me being there.  She also has been rather protective and paranoid that me being at her work (where she hangs out after shift) is causing drama or going to get her fired...which I don&amp;#39;t know, but seems odd.  She takes home a fair amount of cash at the end of the night, which seems like a lot for the position that she is in (waitstaff).  There has been some questionable comments that she has made along the way when she is drunk that piqued my paranoia a bit; I went and looked at her phone and found WhatsApp on there with a single contact and messages.  In it was a conversation that went:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;guy:&amp;lt;some background texting&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wife: Ok. Spoiler Alert... I&amp;#39;m not wearing any underwear. &amp;lt;kissy face emoji&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;guy. Oo la la. Wud be fun. Where can I lick u?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wife: I&amp;#39;m heading over to &amp;lt;another bar near our house&amp;gt;. See ya when u get there &amp;lt;kissy face emoji&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;guy: Got stuck at work. :( Sorry lets plan some other time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked her what this guy was to her... because like WTF?!  She said that she flirts with the customers and that is how she gets such big tips from them and that she is loyal and would never actually act on anything.  Said that he is married and has a 1 yo kid and that they switched to WhatsApp because his wife was suspicious that he was messing around on her.  I feel that this is not right (what he is doing or what she is doing) and I told her that I&amp;#39;m sure any married couple that I knew would not find this kind of thing acceptable even if it was just &amp;quot;part of the industry&amp;quot; and made better tips and that it would not actually go any further than that.  At the very minimum it seems like she is setting herself up to get assaulted or give some guy the wrong impression and have things blow up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She used to do like &amp;quot;cam work&amp;quot; online and I knew about it and was ok with it because John Doe across the country flirting and getting his rocks off and her having some fun was like ok fine...

,Marriage,"I haven't slept well in years, because my husband gets angry (and sometimes abusive) in his sleep. 

This will often carry over to his awake state and I will end up crying or hiding on the couch trying to sleep.

This is a list of examples that are guaranteed to set my husband off the handle in his sleep:  
- If I or the kids in the next room are sick with a cough.
- If I simply clear my throat.
- If I have the sniffles and sniff my nose in bed or sit up to get a tissue.
- If I move too much.
- If I accidentally twist the covers or lay slightly on them to where he has to tug them to get more slack. (Ps- I'm NOT the blanket hog lol)
- (our bed is against a corner.. I sleep against the wall) If I roll over and accident tap the wall too loudly with my knee or elbow.
- If I get up out of bed for ANY REASON (that's the worst one.  I've held in pee for HOURS to avoid his wrath).
- If I bump him at all during the night.
- If one of the kids has a nightmare or something and calls for me. (2 young children).


This list could legit go on for miles.

His most common reactions to these triggers are pushing me in his sleep, pressing his fist or knuckles hard into my body, elbowing me, or swearing and scoffing. (I mean, I think he's asleep.. either that or he's a good actor! &amp; a shitty person.)

I've been up since 4am this morning because my husband scooted so close to me in bed (forcing me flush against the damn wall *never put your bed in a corner lol*) that he took over HALF OF MY PILLOW!  Now let me just say, I knew this was a code red.  
I gently tugged my pillow out from under him (hopefully to prompt him into calming moving over).. but no no no no.. of course not.

He scoffed so loud and moved over like 3 inches while aggressively slamming his hands down.  
Two seconds later, he was still smashing me into the wall, but I tried to lay back down without touching him. Impossible. I lightly bumped him on accident and he said ""mother f&amp;^$^#!"" and SHOVED ME.  

At that point I whispered outloud, ""omg!""

That woke him up (but not entirely.. ya know when you can tell someone is half asleep or ""out of it""?)
Anyway he yelled, ""I'm already on the *bleeping* edge of the bed!!!!"" And by now I was over it because he absolutely WASN'T on his edge at all!! lol so against my better judgment, I said, ""...are you?""

And THAT woke him up entirely.. he SCREAMED profanities (like loud enough to rattle the windows), RIPPED off the blankets, STOMPED out of our room and SLAMMED the door.

Since he actually woke up this time all the way, during his outburst, this will carry over into our day tomorrow.  He will be grumpy all day and complain about how he ""HAD TO"" sleep on the couch...

Call me crazy, but instead of ""walking on eggshells"" (which I do sometimes too).. I primarily SLEEP on them!! He makes me a nervous wreck all night because I'm afraid to move or make a sound or touch him.

,Marriage,"I posted this story as a comment reply ( [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/dcsnl3/comment/f2czlvi) ) on r/WTF when someone mentioned an ""Eastern European Judge"". It reminded me of a story about my wife and I. It got way more attention and love than I expected and seemed to make people feel good, so I thought I'd share it here.

This comment reminds me of my honeymoon. My wife and I did a cruise and she entered a belly flop contest (which I didn't know until they called the contestants names). At least a hundred people gathered around and everyone held up our hands giving scores of 0-5, 0 being a closed fist. 

So I was giving everyone a 0 (kind of had to being my new wife and all). The announcer started calling me ""The Russian Judge"". Making funny comments about it every round, which got a good response from the crowd so he kept making me part of the show.

So my wife is up last, does her thing and I give her a 5. The announcer is like ""Wow! You even impressed the Russian Judge!"" I just help up my hand, didn't say a word and pointed to my wedding ring. Everyone started dying laughing.

She seems always too tired for anything.

Whenever she hangs out with me, she falls asleep shortly after, while she behaves differently with others.

My wife asked to meet up at the house this Sunday. I haven't seen her in almost 4 weeks. I'm scared that it's done, that she doesn't want to come back. My mother-in-law told me she was shocked but to not get my hopes up.

I want to ask her why it happened so suddenly, everything felt fine and normal.

I want to tell her that I'm sorry that I hurt her that she was unhappy for so long. That I should have done more around the house, have dinner with her more often, spend more time with her and less on my computer.

I want to tell her that I want to be with her and make her happy. I want to tell her that even if we drifted apart that I feel like we can find our way back.

But everything I've read says that will only push her away.

,Marriage,"My husband and I have been together for 3  years and some months now, we got married cause I got pregnant and didn't want to raise my baby on my own (I also was going through an spiritual awakening and not having the baby wasn't an option at the moment).

I wasn't in love with him, we were in a FWB  relationship when I got pregnant in spite of using a contraceptive. Just some months before starting to see him, I had finished a relationship that left me broken hearted. So, getting married at the moment seem like a good idea...I thought I could learn to love him and appreciate him in time. 

During the 1st year everything was fine, I was pregnant and he was really nice to me. After some time he started to have violent outbursts during basic arguments (one time he punched a whole in a door and other time, smashed his own glasses);  I have cought him twice having compromising texts with females and after some time, discovered that he didn't finish his nursery degree which really bothered me as since we got married he kept telling that once he got his certificate, he would be able to change jobs and bring more to the table financially (I have always make more than him which  leaves me with the highest portion of financial responsibility at home)  so, he went back to school to finish after I kept telling him that he couldn't just leave school like that.

Ever since, most of his money goes toward his school and I am the one taking care of our child most of the time 

After this time together, I appreciate his loyalty

,Marriage,"I shouldn’t have to question myself if I think you love me anymore, I should just know that you do... but I don’t. You don’t act like it, at least. You used to want to be with me and now you seem to always be away from me. I try to talk to you and I just feel like you don’t hear me, you’re looking at me but you’re not real looking at ME. A lot has changed in 10 years of being together, married almost 8 years and I wonder if it’s what was supposed to happen. 

We married young, you went to the military and changed so quickly, we’re both two different people now. 2 back to back deployments from age 18-19 and 19-20, we spent a lot of time apart... We figured out who OURSELVES were and not each other. We both got so used to being alone after 5 years of military lifestyle. So much so, that sometimes we both still are used to being alone. We used to do everything together, that was in high school though, it’s always different then. What happened to that sweet, sensitive guy though? I truly believe the military ruined our marriage and I know you loved the military so much. We’ve both sacrificed a lot of things for each other... I left my friends and family to move away with you so you could follow your dreams of being in the Navy. Our marriage was rough as fuck while you were in, we were young and a lot was new. You ditched me all the time for your friends and I felt so alone. We separated for a few months, I beg for you, you treat me like dirt, I got over you in an unhealthy way and also started sleeping around. You made it pretty clear you didn’t want me back, you call finally though... I’m rude to you and push you away. I felt like you only wanted me back because you didn’t like the thought of me being with another man. You want me for yourself... and for what? To make me feel unappreciated? Disrespected? To not even pay attention to me? To just keep me around so YOU don’t feel lonely? 

I’ve tried.. I try to talk to you, you don’t get it. You say sorry, it’s useless, then I cry and you comfort me. You tell me you’ll do better and be better but you never do... you never actually hear me. I do so much for you, I cook, I clean, I make sure you have food and work clothes, I do the bills, I grocery shop, I take care of the dogs, I take out the trash and I also run my own business. He works 11-12 hours, I will admit he’s always been a very hard worker. I work too though, let’s not forget. If I ask for help, you tell me I’m “being bossy” and I don’t know why I have to ask someone I share a house with to help me take care of it. I feel like a roommate, I’m just here and there, “Oh hey, I love you!” It’s fucking empty words, what do they even mean? SHOW ME THEN! 

I just don’t deserve this, why do I want to keep trying with you? Will you eventually be the guy I fell in love with or was that just some fairytale shit? The military made you so angry, all the time, about everything. You can’t control it and it stresses me out, your yelling makes me panic. It’s always over small things, “where is my WALLET!!!!???” You slam things, make a mess looking and leave knowing I’ll be there to fix whatever happened in the room. It’s childish, did I do this? Did your mother? Why do I find it so hard to put my foot down? You claim I’m home more so I have the time to do things he doesn’t... though this is true. But you will have 2-3 days off from work and you won’t want to go anywhere or do anything else but play video games... again, childish.

I’m sure there are things wrong with me that you don’t like, there has to be since you don’t ever like to be near me.

I think a lot of these doubts are linked to my mental health. I have depression and the medication I'm taking doesn't really help. I feel very flat a lot of the time and I find myself wanting something exciting and new that isn't familiar and ""boring"" like my wife.

I don't know why I think this now. I've always been happy with her enjoying her job and told her that I'd prefer that she had a bad job that she likes instead of a good job that makes her miserable.

I have a crush on a coworker.

,Marriage,"My husband doesn't sleep well. He leads a relatively unhealthy lifestyle in terms of diet and exercise, he has pain from some health conditions, and he depends on caffeine throughout the day and evening to make it through. In spite of these circumstances, he tells me that the reason he is unable to sleep is because I am snoring too much.  One night a few weeks ago he was up using the bathroom multiple times during the night (which woke me up) and he still said that he had trouble sleeping because of the snoring. I feel like he is using me as a scapegoat for his sleeping issues and I also don't believe that I'm snoring nearly as much as he makes it out to be. 

I've used the Snore Lab app to track noises in the room and the data doesn't agree with his claim that I'm snoring (Average snore score of 14 which is below average, snore 10% of the time, loud snoring 4% of the time, and epic snoring 0% of the time). It's worse in winter than in summer because of stuffy noses and cold, dry air. I've shown this to him and he blows it off because he is 'going to believe {his} own ears' and he's not going to 'trust a $5 app'.

The more that he says that I'm the reason he is unable to sleep the more I get angry at the accusation. We've talked about this issue in marriage counseling and he doesn't want to accept that his behavior could be impacting his sleep (e.g., he says that caffeine 'has no impact' on him). He was assessed for sleep apnea also and got a CPAP but decided it didn't do anything and has stopped using it and seeing his sleep doctor. I don't know what to do anymore.

I've have never been married before. It has been a little bit more than a year now that I'm with my girlfriend. She is awesome. I like her a lot as a person. I like spending time with her, I like her ideals, education, humour...

Do you think it's good idea to marry her?

,Marriage," 

I think most of us know that when times are tough, we seem to fight more with our partner, but have you ever wondered why? How financial stress is transferred right into relationship problems?

Well, there are 2 areas of the brain mostly responsible for this, the amygdala and the brain stem. Without going into huge detail, our amygdala registers the **fear** that comes with financial stresses, and before we know it, it has communicated that to our brain stem which goes into survival mode and has us responding in either **fight, flight or freezing.**

Whichever one is chosen, whenever we are in this survival mode, we are reactive, and it is this **reactivity** that makes it very difficult for us to be open and receptive to others, which is necessary to have a good relationship with them.

So, we can’t stay open and attune to others, we don’t pause before responding, we can’t empathise with another, we have trouble getting a deeper insight into what is going on between us, we lose contact with our intuition, and we lose access to our moral awareness.

This then has us going down the low road rather than the higher road in our communications with our partner. Once this negative spiral starts, it usually goes nowhere but down, getting quite ugly at times. There are no happy endings unless it is stopped.

We are all potentially prone to this kind of disintegration. The key is to firstly recognise what is happening, and catch yourself as early as possible.

Taking personal responsibility for yourself is the first thing to do.  As soon as you feel yourself **reacting rather than responding**, when you can feel emotional upset or emotional charge internally, then put up your hand, interrupt the conversation, and say to your partner “I am being reactive”.

Arrange with your partner for this to signal   “We need to stop for 15 minutes, spend time on our own settling down and reflecting on what just happened and why, then come back and return to the conversation from a more aware and neutral place”.

If you can both agree to do this each time either of you is feeling reactive, you can save a huge amount of wasted energy and upset in arguments, and really get to having a healthy conversation, even if , to start with, it is punctuated with a few breaks.

For further help with your communication and relationship problems, I urge you to seek [relationship counselling](https://thehartcentre.com.au/locations/) as early as possible, as there is always a solution to a problematic situation.

,Marriage,"This might be a little long so bear with me. 

A little background. I come from a middle eastern back ground. Marriage and divorce are not words that are thrown around that easily. I was born and raised in a somewhat westernized culture but have retained my culture and traditions. 

I had got married to a girl in the US that was from the same culture, seemed amazing at first, had her sister move in with us, and for almost 3.5 years, lived with us and turns out was scamming a guy for a citizenship. Finally it turned out my ex was on the same plan, married me for a citizenship. A nasty divorce ensued. And all was done. 

Fast forward a couple of years, I meet a lovely girl from my original hometown (mind you, I never have lived in my hometown, always abroad) and I get to know her. She works, knows how to manage her financials, has friends and knows how to interact socially. Two years later, I marry her and bring her to the US. Mind you, entire time we were courting, I adamantly expressed that I do not have the financial means to bring anyone except her to the US. Her family is average, doesn’t have extra money to their name, and are living say to day in normal situations. 

Here is my issue, I understand that she is in a new setting, new culture, new surroundings, new country and might be experiencing culture shock. She has been here for almost a year but I am noticing things that are causing red flags. She does not want to get a job, she multiple times has mentioned that she has no intention of working. (She leaves it vague by saying I don’t mind working, just don’t want to work office hours.) 
She has not put in an effort to learn the language yet. I have gave her books, tapes and audio drives, but she has not touched any of them. 
She spends the whole day sleeping and lounging about the house and does not try to show that she has a goal to do anything. She just watches tv and plays games on her phone while I am at work. 
Cooking, she will cook every couple of days, every time she does, she complains about how she hates to cook. 
Driving, she is waiting for paperwork to be able to drive and I have multiple times told her to read up on the written part so that she will get her license quicker and she has not even touched any of the material. 

In the bedroom she is inexperienced which has caused some strain where I have to always initiate and I have to always bring it up. Going on a year, if I don’t bring it up, she is ok with living as roommates and does not want to try anything new. It has been difficult for me to maintain being turned on with her. She is suprisingly resistant to everything in the bedroom. I have taken my time and believe me I haven’t scared her from anything. 

Please don’t get me wrong, she is an amazing individual. Very caring, pays attention to detail. I love her. I love everything she does and she tries to do. She is an amazing person. But surprisingly dry and inexperienced. She is nearing 31 years of age and I believe that there is some things should at least know from tv, friends, familial relationships that I have to remind her to do. She is educated and has a great amount of common sense. 

I don’t know if I am allowing my previous marriage to affect me, but sometimes I feel like we are not compatible. I don’t know. I feel lost and I can’t tell anyone around me, because everyone around me already compare her to my ex and I am worried it will be ammunition for them to bash her.

,Marriage,"So first of all, I wasn’t expecting so many responses - and so many of them thoughtful and honest, to my previous post. 

Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/dbha14/what_happens_to_sexually_incompatible_marriages/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Thank you, and I wanted to give you all an update and further thoughts for discussion.

After that second update post, my husband and I talked about it further. And I think I’m more at peace (?) with knowing that there is definitely wrong with his sex drive that’s related to a mental block as opposed to simply not knowing what was causing all of this. 

I think he has something called hsdd - Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) or inhibited sexual desire (ISD) is considered a sexual dysfunction and is characterized as a lack or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. 

He doesn’t just have a low libido, or substituting porn for sex, he isn’t gay or asexual and also not having an affair. However, he doesn’t have a fetish, a kink, or sexual fantasy - but he CAN be visually turned on under the right circumstances. He won’t actually seek that out cause he doesn’t feel the need for sexual urge. 

For him, foreplay is an act of service for my sake. He literally gets no enjoyment from the act of turning me on. It’s a chore and pressure for him because he isn’t aroused by making me horny in another words. 

His favorite lullaby, lol, is me giving him a hand job while he has a hard on, or giving him a blowjob and falling asleep to it. So to make it clear, he likes me touching his penis, it feels good for him, but it doesn’t relate to sexual arousal, it’s just like a nice massage.

When reading my post and all of your comments, his questions I think revealed a lot about his mindset on sex. He asked me: What does feeling sexy mean? What does being a sexual person mean? I explained to him, and that it’s different from feeling horny, and he said he doesn’t get that and never felt that way. 

When he did used to watch porn, he says it wasn’t even about feeling horny, but stress relieving. I don’t quite know how to take that, but to give him every benefit of the doubt, I think it’s like saying “I’m stressed out and I need to cheat on my diet by have ice cream”. And when he did watch porn, it was just regular sex but not zeroing in on the foreplay, or female voice or facial expression, or her enjoyment of it, it was literally just watching ass and doggy style or cowgirl, not for the breast aspect or woman being in control, but cause it’s the laziest and the most comfortable form of having sex for him. 

He understands that ideally, sex should be mutually enjoyable but he thinks that’s media fantasy. In reality, it’s usually one person for the taking and you take turns. 

So the issues of physical hormones, and overall selfishness in the bedroom are all parts of our issue but fundamentally, his view on sex is warped, and his brain isn’t being aroused like a normal brain would. Which when you put it out there as a brain dysfunction, it makes so much sense why he doesn’t seem to desire sex, get aroused normally, doesn’t have any sexual fantasy or fetishes, and his ED issues are probably stemming from that as he’s young and not obese. 

I do wonder why he is like this though. He doesn’t know why either. There are few different types of HSDD, and in his case, it seems to be that of general- acquired, meaning it hasn’t been this way all his life and it started with me and it isn’t caused by having an affair.

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, and I wanted to give you all an update and further thoughts for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that second update post, my husband and I talked about it further. And I think I’m more at peace (?) with knowing that there is definitely wrong with his sex drive that’s related to a mental block as opposed to simply not knowing what was causing all of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think he has something called hsdd - Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) or inhibited sexual desire (ISD) is considered a sexual dysfunction and is characterized as a lack or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He doesn’t just have a low libido, or substituting porn for sex, he isn’t gay or asexual and also not having an affair. However, he doesn’t have a fetish, a kink, or sexual fantasy - but he CAN be visually turned on under the right circumstances. He won’t actually seek that out cause he doesn’t feel the need for sexual urge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For him, foreplay is an act of service for my sake. He literally gets no enjoyment from the act of turning me on. It’s a chore and pressure for him because he isn’t aroused by making me horny in another words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His favorite lullaby, lol, is me giving him a hand job while he has a hard on, or giving him a blowjob and falling asleep to it. So to make it clear, he likes me touching his penis, it feels good for him, but it doesn’t relate to sexual arousal, it’s just like a nice massage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When reading my post and all of your comments, his questions I think revealed a lot about his mindset on sex. He asked me: What does feeling sexy mean? What does being a sexual person mean? I explained to him, and that it’s different from feeling horny, and he said he doesn’t get that and never felt that way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he did used to watch porn, he says it wasn’t even about feeling horny, but stress relieving. I don’t quite know how to take that, but to give him every benefit of the doubt, I think it’s like saying “I’m stressed out and I need to cheat on my diet by have ice cream”. And when he did watch porn, it was just regular sex but not zeroing in on the foreplay, or female voice or facial expression, or her enjoyment of it, it was literally just watching ass and doggy style or cowgirl, not for the breast aspect or woman being in control, but cause it’s the laziest and the most comfortable form of having sex for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He understands that ideally, sex should be mutually enjoyable but he thinks that’s media fantasy. In reality, it’s usually one person for the taking and you take turns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the issues of physical hormones, and overall selfishness in the bedroom are all parts of our issue but fundamentally, his view on sex is warped, and his brain isn’t being aroused like a normal brain would. Which when you put it out there as a brain dysfunction, it makes so much sense why he doesn’t seem to desire sex, get aroused normally, doesn’t have any sexual fantasy or fetishes, and his ED issues are probably stemming from that as he’s young and not obese. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do wonder why he is like this though. He doesn’t know why either. There are few different types of HSDD, and in his case, it seems to be that of general- acquired, meaning it hasn’t been this way all his life and it started with me and it isn’t caused by having an affair. He was lustful with me prior to marriage so maybe a mental block with marriage and sex?? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone else familiar with HSDD? I think it makes a lot of sense. What do you all think? We are going to find a sex therapist for him and see how that goes...&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"We are both in mid-to-late 30s with an 18 month old, living in a foreign country where I work in a middle management role for a post-startup tech company. We have been living here for about 3 years now and I'm ""gold-handcuffed"" to this job for a couple more years. I am also typing this out at work, in an email client, so I'll inevitably sound like a business-casual clad robot with an access card on a lanyard and an emotional malfunction.  

My wife does not work, as she speaks the local language well enough to almost get by, but not quite well enough to find a job and the ""norm"" in the country where we both come from is for children to stay home until they are about two. That said, our daughter has been spending 5 hours per day at a daycare since she turned one. Our daughter is a healthy, happy and very active child, who rarely, if ever, sits still and is always climbing, jumping or running somewhere. 

Financially we are okay. Not saving as much as we should, but generally remaining in the black, with a healthy emergency fund and decent long term savings. We travel a bit too much, which eats into the ability to save, but it is necessary to cope with the place we live in right now. It is nominally a developed country with some things going for it, but living here is way more frustrating than it would be elsewhere. 

Emotionally, the last year has been very draining and the marriage has became rockier over the past few months. There's plenty to unpack, so I will try to describe as fairly and concisely as I can. 

My wife has a hard time coping. It is a mix of homesickness, lingering postpartum, parenting stress, isolation, unemployment and being a self-perceived financial burden. Any single one of these reasons are enough to make someone depressed, so I do not blame her at all for having a hard time and I try to be as supportive as I can. Mostly by doing some housework on the weekends and evenings, having frequent playtime with our daughter, arranging trips back home whenever, avoiding criticism, etc.  

What is missing and frustrating my wife is a lack of intimacy and affection and that is where I am coming up short. We used to be quite physically affectionate in the past, but these days I feel as if between work and family responsibilities I am running ragged myself and have nothing left to give. My sex drive is practically nonexistent, I long for alone time and physical affection like hugs and embraces no longer comes naturally to me and feel like another chore instead. I don't quite know how to fix this and whether I am able to at this point. 

There's a part of my mind that's giving us a 50/50 chance of separation or divorce within the next two years if nothing improves and yet another part that thinks that it would not be the worst outcome.

,Marriage,"Newlyweds here. We got married really quickly. In the beginning, my husband (30) had a high libido, incredibly romantic, passionate, and just in every way perfect. He'd shower me with compliments, tell me how much I meant to him, and I felt like the most special person in the world.

,Marriage,"Hi! Sorta new here. Not sure really where to start. Wife and I (both 27) been married just over 2.5 years. Looking for some insight on the way I’ve been feeling lately to see if there is anything legit there or if I’m just a giant self centered a-hole.

Lately I’ve felt like things have been very one way. I’m a giant pushover so I’m sure that’s part of the issue, but it is starting to eat at me. 

I’ll try not to make this too long but a few instances have been (in no particular order).

-Moving; we both work full time I work in the family business and am set to take over in the next couple years so I am pretty much stuck within a decent radius of my job. She works in medical in a specialized field, sometimes difficult to find work in. When she was first looking for work after school we discussed options and I agreed that I would be willing to have up to a 2 hour commute which pretty much allowed her to work anywhere in our state. She ended up getting a job about an hour and a half away from mine, and we agreed to move to a town right in the middle of our two jobs where we had some family and friends. 6 months in and it’s not the job for her, she finds a new job which happens to be in the same town as mine. All of the sudden we can’t live that far away from work and we need to move closer ASAP. I objected to that as we have already been commuting the same distance and now we could even carpool. I am someone who likes to settle, I lived in 3 houses my entire life and uprooting and moving every year is not something I enjoy. Also being that we had just bought our house and it would be difficult to try and sell it so soon and not end up upside down financially. I was told I was being silly and needed to consider family time and pretty much got the silent treatment until I agreed to look at houses.

I suppose it’s relevant to mention that we had a beautiful baby in February so uprooting our lives with an infant in tow was especially stressful.

Family; I am fortunate enough that my family lives pretty close by, hers on the other hand are scattered all over the country. It’s constantly a point of contention that my family gets to be involved in our baby growing up and hers doesn’t. I’ve offered to pay or use points to fly them in any time, or fly her to them but that’s not good enough. Which I get that she wants her family to get to see the baby and be close but there seems to be resentment forming against mine and that it won’t be fair unless my family is only able to see the baby as much as hers is. 

One specific incident was just two days ago, her family is all coming in to spend Christmas with us and celebrate the baby’s first Christmas. However I was told it would be too much if my parents stopped by the house on Christmas Day to see the baby for an hour and it would take away from her visit with her family. I was told to pick another weekend to celebrate with my family and the baby, and that maybe if it wasn’t too stressful of a week they could come for dinner Christmas Eve. 

Two weeks ago I was hit with a bad case of the flu. It literally put me in bed for the better part of 3 days. Now normally if I catch a cold or something I can power through and still pull my weight around the house and at work but this time I physically couldn’t. I never asked for anything or any special treatment I just wanted to stay in bed and rest. However the minute I said I would prefer not to take the baby to daycare in the morning I was met with anger and I even heard her tell someone she was feeling resentful toward me for being sick. 
Anytime she’s been sick I’ve taken off work, and done anything I can to take care of her, kept the house up etc... 

It is frowned upon if I take a day off work to hang out with friends who I don’t get to see much anymore since we’ve moved. I get constantly told how she wishes she could see her friends and spend time with them like I do. The thing is though I offer to have them over to the house, cook dinner, pour drinks, or I’ll take the baby for the night and she can go do whatever but she won’t do it. I’ll sometimes just text her friends to come hang out with her so she will feel good and smile.

My work schedule is pretty erratic and has me traveling and in different places a lot so we agreed to create a calendar between us that we would put everything on so we could see where each other would be. I am very diligent about updating the calendar as needed however she now needs me to have a conversation with her about what I am doing for the week as she doesn’t pay attention to the calendar. However if I miss something I get told I should’ve looked at the calendar. 

She will constantly change her and the baby’s schedule by +/- 30mins and act like I should’ve always known it had changed. Such as moving the baby’s bed time from 8 to 7:30 or telling me that if I want sex to happen I need to be in bed by 9 and not 10 like it had been. 

We also keep very different schedules, she gets up early and likes going to bed early. I’ll stay up pretty late and sleep till about 8am. I’ve never asked her to change her schedule for me, but I am expected to drop what I am doing at 9 and lay in bed with her until she goes to sleep and then I can do whatever I want after. Which is fine I don’t mind that but then when she gets up to get ready in the morning all the lights come on, doors and drawers slamming and the works. Which means I end up averaging 4 or so hours of sleep per night. 

The last thing I’ll mention in this post is the matter of sex. We just can’t see eye to eye on if. I am a very touchy feely person and as stereotypical as it is I need frequent sex. Touch is my love language it’s how I feel connected and it’s how I communicate love. She could do without. We’ve had many discussions about this and a lot of times it just leads to both of us angry and me sulking about in the living room. I felt like we had a break through when we had discussed this a month ago and things were going really well. We had even agreed on a frequency that was good with both of us, however in the recent weeks it’s gone downhill again and I’m constantly being rejected. Because sleep is more important to her, or she would rather watch her favorite tv show or she has to get up early for work etc... tonight was rough though, I tried talking to her and she just laughed and thought I was trying to start something. When I actually tried to initiate tonight she laughed again at me saying I looked pitiful and then mumbled that she can’t keep up with my needs, and proceeded to say we can make extra time tomorrow night for it which I would’ve been fine with but again she didn’t look at the calendar and see that I had a dinner meeting scheduled that would last well past her bed time, to which she said it was my fault I wouldn’t get any the rest of the week because I never told her about the meeting even though we had multiple conversations about it. 

She won’t even speak about seeing someone whether it be together or by herself. She says she doesn’t have time and won’t ask for any work off because that’s more important and she doesn’t want to seem weak in front of her peers. I’ve even asked her to go part time or stop working altogether but she won’t have it.

We’ve had many discussions about this and a lot of times it just leads to both of us angry and me sulking about in the living room. I felt like we had a break through when we had discussed this a month ago and things were going really well. We had even agreed on a frequency that was good with both of us, however in the recent weeks it’s gone downhill again and I’m constantly being rejected. Because sleep is more important to her, or she would rather watch her favorite tv show or she has to get up early for work etc... tonight was rough though, I tried talking to her and she just laughed and thought I was trying to start something. When I actually tried to initiate tonight she laughed again at me saying I looked pitiful and then mumbled that she can’t keep up with my needs, and proceeded to say we can make extra time tomorrow night for it which I would’ve been fine with but again she didn’t look at the calendar and see that I had a dinner meeting scheduled that would last well past her bed time, to which she said it was my fault I wouldn’t get any the rest of the week because I never told her about the meeting even though we had multiple conversations about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She won’t even speak about seeing someone whether it be together or by herself. She says she doesn’t have time and won’t ask for any work off because that’s more important and she doesn’t want to seem weak in front of her peers. I’ve even asked her to go part time or stop working altogether but she won’t have it. We don’t need both salaries we can live more than comfortable off just mine but alas.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi marriage reddit, this is my first post regarding my marriage. 

We have been going through a rough zone that seems to never end. Its starts with an amazing, passionate, wonderful connection, then with a still birth about year 1 (to naive to know what a connection is).   
Then rainbow baby yr 2 (feel like something is wrong with us but hopeful connection can get better #difficultpregnancy), baby takes all of our efforts.  
2nd baby yr 4 (connection not improved, probably worse due to resentment and sexual frustration).  
Year 6 = 3rd baby (time flys we are less sure but have a family to think about so kinda fake it).   
Year 9 (we are talking about separation).

Sry bout the confusing history but its backstory which yall might glean insights. We are year 10 come may and I honestly didn't feel like I have a connection period. She seems to get her cuddle needs from the baby and co sleeping has taken a toll on our intimacy and connection. Plus side, we are talking openly about all issues and kinda giving it a trial run. We find out she is demi-sexual, which is where someone requires a connection to feel sexually attracted. Since we have no connection, it's like a wake up call. She requires help around the house to feel a connection. 

Personally, I kinda want a new connection where I have more natural chemistry and like each other more. Plus, freedom to be myself in my own environment without feeling guilty or like I am doing wrong. Basically, would like to come home and have a beer without feeling like she is counting how many I had that week. Or go play some discgolf on a wednesday without feeling like she just wants me to be home with the kids. Also, I say I am going to lose weight and she laughs and says ""I will believe it when I see it"". I create music and tell her I am going to get serious and license it and she laughs and shows me how much she doubts me. I want someone that wants me for me and believes in me and loves me for me. What should I do yall?

(After typing this and not posting it; we talked. This is a summary of what I said:) 

I don't feel like I am being honest with you. I feel like doing this trial for the next few months will add up to me faking it. I am not confident that I will ever be able to 'get there' again. I feel like I am in love with who you used to be at the very beginning in hopes that she will come back, but I have been thinking that the last couple years. I feel like we have had our ups and downs, my faults, your faults, kids faults, etc, but in the end we have had our connection severed and I don't see it ever healing. 

(My summary of Her response)

I am indifferent. We will have to move somewhere that she won't have to work every hour of her life to survive.

Now what do yall think?

,Marriage,"What are some recommendations on how to deal with a sad partner?

Here's my situation. My spouse has been actimg off for about a week. Highly irritable, kinda jerky, and just uninterested in anything I or our child says or does. He  will literally zone out and ignore us. This behavior is very unusual for him. He's typically clingy af to the point where it's kinda annoying. Yesterday he looked at me and said ""I think I'm depressed""  and I basically like hmmm you have seemed off. Are you sure this isn't an extended period of sadness? Are things just not bringing you joy anymore? When was the last time you felt joy from something you love? (I was trying to pinpoint when or what caused this)

Now I had depression. It's still around but it was pretty bad for the last few years and got significantly better in the last 6 months or so. I saw a psychologist weekly which helped drastically, but my life had to change for me to get over that hurddle. My depression started over a very specific event occuring and me not being able to handle the event, the change in my lifestyle, marriage, and self both physically and mentally. I knew from the second the incident occurred that no good could come from it and everything spiraled from there. 

Although I'm aware that depression is like birdbox and it's different for everyone, don't people usually have a reason to be depressed even if it doesn't make sense or isn't true? I find it difficult to talk to my spouse about this because he gives me nothing. I ask if he may be dressed about something and he gets an attitude and says ""why would I be stressed, what is there to stress about?"" I'm like money, the house, the kid, the marriage, work, school, anything. And he says ""why would I stress about money we're fine, why would I stress about the house it's fine. The kid is fine.""  Etc etc . I tried explaining that I stress about everything when I was depressed that could happen. I worried about uncertainty and future events that may or may not occur, it's actually typical to be sad and realize you have no reason to be sad and that making you even more depressed. He rolled his eyes.

So I sighed and took a break but eventually reccomended that he just go speak to a professional but he sincerely frowns upon that idea. I'm hoping that he's just feeling down for a few weeks and gets through it, I don't wish depression on anyone. I've reccomended he get some alone time and he said he thinks he has alone time.

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my situation. My spouse has been actimg off for about a week. Highly irritable, kinda jerky, and just uninterested in anything I or our child says or does. He  will literally zone out and ignore us. This behavior is very unusual for him. He&amp;#39;s typically clingy af to the point where it&amp;#39;s kinda annoying. Yesterday he looked at me and said &amp;quot;I think I&amp;#39;m depressed&amp;quot;  and I basically like hmmm you have seemed off. Are you sure this isn&amp;#39;t an extended period of sadness? Are things just not bringing you joy anymore? When was the last time you felt joy from something you love? (I was trying to pinpoint when or what caused this)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I had depression. It&amp;#39;s still around but it was pretty bad for the last few years and got significantly better in the last 6 months or so. I saw a psychologist weekly which helped drastically, but my life had to change for me to get over that hurddle. My depression started over a very specific event occuring and me not being able to handle the event, the change in my lifestyle, marriage, and self both physically and mentally. I knew from the second the incident occurred that no good could come from it and everything spiraled from there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;#39;m aware that depression is like birdbox and it&amp;#39;s different for everyone, don&amp;#39;t people usually have a reason to be depressed even if it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense or isn&amp;#39;t true? I find it difficult to talk to my spouse about this because he gives me nothing. I ask if he may be dressed about something and he gets an attitude and says &amp;quot;why would I be stressed, what is there to stress about?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m like money, the house, the kid, the marriage, work, school, anything. And he says &amp;quot;why would I stress about money we&amp;#39;re fine, why would I stress about the house it&amp;#39;s fine. The kid is fine.&amp;quot;  Etc etc . I tried explaining that I stress about everything when I was depressed that could happen. I worried about uncertainty and future events that may or may not occur, it&amp;#39;s actually typical to be sad and realize you have no reason to be sad and that making you even more depressed. He rolled his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I sighed and took a break but eventually reccomended that he just go speak to a professional but he sincerely frowns upon that idea. I&amp;#39;m hoping that he&amp;#39;s just feeling down for a few weeks and gets through it, I don&amp;#39;t wish depression on anyone. I&amp;#39;ve reccomended he get some alone time and he said he thinks he has alone time. I reccomended he go out with some friends but he said he doesn&amp;#39;t want to (which isn&amp;#39;t really his thing anyways). He games but doesn&amp;#39;t get into it like he used to (1-2 hours instead or 4-8) because time management with work and family and stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

Well, I didn't miss any, according to the statements, but I noticed these charges for $40-$50 bucks a day at a gas station by the house. I go to ask her if she knew about this and she looks at me and says ""I messed up"" I asked her to clarify, she tells me that she has been buying these pills at the gas station. She buys them because they ""make her feel good"". Come to find out, these pills are synthetic opioids!! She was taking an entire bottle of 15 pills a day at $40 bucks a pop, plus her pack of cigarettes a day @ $6 bucks a pack! All in all, she was costing us an extra $1200 or more a month for her two habits.

,Marriage,"We've identified that my wife's biggest issue with our marriage is feeling controlled. This has come about from if she is doing 'X', and I know of a 'better' way, or I have more experience with something I will often 'suggest' that she does it in a particular way. From my perspective I'm just trying to help, teach, or prevent issues, but obviously this comes off very different. She feels when I 'suggest' something, I'm telling her to do something, and really she has no choice, hence feeling controlled. I agree.

So I've tried to back off, but there are still certain situations where I feel the need... I guess to control... but I'll refer to it as 'help'. Let's take a simple example which has brought literal tears: Cutting an apple

My wife is not good in the kitchen. Her main skill is heating things in a microwave. I have considerable experience in the kitchen. Whenever my wife cuts an apple she does so by holding an apple in one hand, taking a knife in her other hand, and cutting through the apple with the blade going directly towards her hand. She cuts her hand maybe 30% of the time she uses a knife in the kitchen.

All I'd like is for her to use a cutting board instead of cutting in a dangerous way. Of course (this is how she sees it, and I agree) this is me trying to control something as mundane as how she cuts an apple. Which has led to huge frustrations, and tears. I guess I view this particular example differently because it's related to health and safety. And I see as a husband it's my job to protect her. So it's hard for me to not to protect her... from herself. Which involves controlling behavior. Which she resents me for.

,Marriage,"My husband and I have heated arguments sometimes and it often happens when I ask him to help do a chore or I let him know he’s done something that hurts me or I don’t like. I feel he doesn’t fully listen to it, then brings up something that’s bothering him, and expects me to listen to what’s bothering him instead of helping me work through what’s on my mind. If I don’t address his concerns he gets upset that I’m not respecting him. It often results in a heated argument of yelling, him telling me I’m too sensitive, selfish, or something to that extent. He has said “fuck you”, gets up and yells in my face, will slam his fist on something, and this often happens with our children present. They have cried because they’re so upset at the situation. They’re 9 and 11. Sometimes I yell too and get angry. I’m guilty of it but I try not to cuss or name call because I know it’s wrong. I’ve done it but not ok with it and trying to change that. I used to get really heated and I’m trying my best to keep my cool, although it’s hard to do.  I find that I reach a point where I try to tell him we can calmly talk it out, stop yelling at me, and I care about him and love him. He’s so upset that I don’t think he cares about a thing I said. My heart’s desire is to sit down calmly, have each of us talk through it, and reach a mutual agreement and I tell him that. We haven’t reached that point of being able to do that. I cry in the argument, I cry alone, I often can’t sleep after an argument, and I have a significant amount of anxiety due to our relationship. 
Sometimes he is calm enough so I can finally get a word in. I say some things and soon he tells me he’s exhausted, I’m wearing him out, and he doesn’t want to talk anymore. He is rude and insensitive sometimes but often doesn’t recognize it.
I’m trying to love him the best I know how. He tells me he loves me one moment but then one perceived wrong will set him off. Sometimes he says he’s done with me but nothing becomes of it. He often assigns motives to me that don’t exist. He thinks I’m doing things to him out of spite or trying to hurt him. That’s not the case and I tell him that. I consider myself an empathetic, conscientious person that tries to do good with the occasional slip up.
This is a continuous cycle of fights and apologies and it’s exhausting me. It’s exhausting him too but I get the impression he thinks it’s my fault when he lashes out.

I’m trying to love him the best I know how. He tells me he loves me one moment but then one perceived wrong will set him off. Sometimes he says he’s done with me but nothing becomes of it. He often assigns motives to me that don’t exist. He thinks I’m doing things to him out of spite or trying to hurt him. That’s not the case and I tell him that. I consider myself an empathetic, conscientious person that tries to do good with the occasional slip up.
This is a continuous cycle of fights and apologies and it’s exhausting me. It’s exhausting him too but I get the impression he thinks it’s my fault when he lashes out.
We are going through a marriage enrichment program at our church, I’m going to individual counseling, and we’ve gone to counseling together a few times. It feels like it’s not changing much.
I feel my husband has such deep hurt or resentments, that he’s having a hard time coming to terms with his heart. I don’t feel he loves me, although he says he does, and I get the impression he doesn’t think he is a large part of the problem (if I suggest he’s a large part, he’ll put it back on me and say I’m the problem)
Anyone been through a similar situation? Have you been able to change your marriage? I’m open to any thoughts/advice.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"So my wife of 8 years has been cheating on me for 3 years, I found out from her exbestfriend what she was doing and that her exbestfriend (imma call her lucy) was picking up my kids and taking care of them until she eventually came back (I was at work when she did everything) ahe told me because she got tired of keeping the secret. 

I kicked her out and filed for divorce as well as sole custody of our kids, so she started showing up around our area and harassing me about how I found out and tried taking the kids so I put an order of protection to stop her. Ever since then ive been trying to sort out my life, I gave up my good job and became a stay at home dad for now while I setup child care and I'm  doing the single father thing again. 

Now heres the sorta, I spend everyday with Lucy and we have developed feeling for each other but we refrain from doing to much because she has alot going on too and it doesnt seem like thats what I need right now. With that being said everywhere we go women ask her if I'm her man and she says yes and I do the same when guys ask if she's mine.

My wife called me today asking if she can come back. I said if I did that you would cheat on me and not be taking care of the kids again when rn they have me and they know that theyre going to be good with me. 

She then says what if I came back and only was there for the kids. You can go back to work and be with Lucy. I said no because 1st me and Lucy arent together, 2nd if the boys were your priority you would of always been there for them instead of Lucy or I wouldnt of had to leave my job on several occasions to get them. 

I hang up and told Lucy about the call and she says for someone going through the death of a marriage and being a single father you dont show any sadness, anger or depression. 

I told her that's because I had my suspicions but didnt want to know since the kids were still good but when she stopped caring for the kids I stopped caring for her. 

I hold no hate, no anger for me personally only that she wasnt doing right by the kids. She said thats why your always calm, always thinking about the next step and then doing it. That's why I love you, it's not that nothing phases you, its that you take everything into consideration and then make the best decision not for you but your kids. 

I was stuck because she knows the mornings are the worst for me, I wake up missing her but it stops when I remember that the person I married isnt the person that was here. 

As for Lucy we chill and drink most weekends away, while our kids play in the other room. We just vibe to our souls and some misic, To the point that time just disappears. 

We have not had sex yet but that's our choice sometimes she says she wants to and I stop her. Its not that I dont want to its more about the fact that im still married and I believe that I should close 1 chapter before starting another. 

Plus I havent been with another woman in 8 years, so its the history that is getting me to restrain myself, and she knows it and respects that I have morals.

,Marriage,"my wife doesn't know how to smile. she says she wants to or feels like it sometimes, but she doesn't really ""know how to"". 

she feels very self-conscious when taking pics, and she tries to avoid being in pictures at all (that's why she usually wants to be the photographer, not the subject). she never takes selfies (and i mean never, as in, she's never done it...not once). 

when she tries smiling, she gets weird and awkward and says ""stop looking at me dammit, you're making me self-conscious"". i don't try to make her do things she doesn't want to do, but she seems unhappy a lot of the time because sometimes she wants to be included, but she's too fearful about looking awk.

she'll laugh if you make her laugh, but even then she catches herself and stops, or she'll purse her lips shut or cover her mouth. it's not like she has messed up teeth or anything. she just doesn't know how to smile naturally.

sometimes she says ""i'm not a silly person. i'm a serious person"". once in awhile i'll want to take fun pictures with her or of her, but she really doesn't want to. so i've long since stopped trying, since it just makes her nervous, then she gets frustrated and angry, and i don't want to make her feel bad or put her into a bad mood.

,Marriage,"TL;DR: I am pretty sure my wife had a meltdown but I am not sure why. I fucked up by crying to my daughter about it.

I want to preface this by saying that my wife (43F) and I (43M) have been in marriage counseling for more than a year now. Despite this, we are in the situation I am about to relate.

Last evening I went into our bathroom to take a shower and my wife had been cleaning the bathroom. She was very stressed and had what I can only describe as an angry, annoyed demeanor. I asked if she was done so that I could take a shower because we actually had an appointment with the the therapist that evening. She got annoyed with me and asked me if I could use the other shower because she just cleaned this one. I didn't understand why, so I asked her why it mattered that she just cleaned this one and that I didn't like the other one. She then started attacking me on how I never put my clothes away and that she's constantly cleaning the house 24/7 and that I don't help her. She wasn't just complaining, she was raising her voice and using a really annoyed, parental tone, which I feel that did not deserve. I didn't want to keep getting yelled at (or yell back at her and create a scene), so I went back into my office. She came into my office and we started talking. I asked what was wrong, and she got SO upset with me, saying ""I ALREADY TOLD YOU I WASN'T FEELING WELL, WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN TO ME OR GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ME??"". Indeed, she had told me earlier that she was feeling a weak and tired, but I didn't understand how her tirade was connected to this. I guess I'm just a stupid man who doesn't understand her.

She continued saying things like this and then going off on how I don't love her, appreciate her, etc. She was yelling this at me in a very angry tone. Then all the sudden she buries her face in her hands and starts sobbing. Despite just being yelled at, I calmly sat face to face with her and tried to console her. I seriously didn't know what she was so upset about or what I did. She suddenly got up and left. I remained in my office, stunned at what just happened and I stared at the wall for 15 minutes. Eventually, to keep the peace, I went into the ""other"" shower, and when I was done, went into our bedroom to get dressed. She came STORMING in, stomping and huffing and puffing. I asked her to stop and talk to me and to please explain to me why she was so angry. We got into yet another argument and I kept saying I didn't understand why we she so distraught. She started sobbing again and had this really crazy look in her eyes, saying ""PLEASE, PLEASE, JUST LET ME GO!"" and kept repeating that over and over again. I was NOT keeping her there at all! Tears were streaming down her face and she looked like she was doubled over in pain...as if she had just suffered the loss of a child or something. She was completely inconsolable. I told her that she was scaring me and that if she didn't stop I would call 911, but she continued.

At this point, I was getting distraught myself. In fact, as I am typing this, my heart is pounding and I am feeling upset as I recall these events. Anyway, I quickly put on my clothes. She leaves and locks herself in the bathroom. I go downstairs. My daughter (18) is cooking something and I sit down in the kitchen and start crying. At this point, I feel uncontrollably sad and confused myself, as I simply do not understand what the fuck just happened. My daughter asks what's going on and I told her I didn't know what was wrong with mom. She got this really pissed off look on her face and asked what I did to her! I explained the situation as best as I could, then she bolted up the stairs to try to talk to her, but my wife had locked herself in the bathroom and wouldn't let her in. She then came down and tried to console me because at this point I was crying.

Eventually, I did calm down, but I felt it would be best if I left the house to cool off. My wife called me about 20 minutes later and was acting as if nothing happened, sarcastically asking if we were taking 2 cars to the counselor. I tried to explain that I am no condition to talk to anyone right now and that I needed to just cool off. She said ""Oh, it's always ALL about you"" then hung up on me. I called her back, and she answered by saying she was ""too busy"" to talk to me and hung up on me again. That's the last communication we had.

Later that evening, my son (21) called me and we talked about what happened. Apparently, my daughter got really scared about the whole situation and thought we were having panic attacks or something. It was a very difficult conversation.

I think I made some huge mistakes here. 

1) I should not have come crying to my daughter. I really didn't want her to be involved in this and I unfairly put her through stress that she didn't need. I also feel that doing this may have caused her to take my side, which I am trying to avoid.

2) I should have controlled my emotions better in the first place. I don't know why I became so upset, but I can tell you it was very disturbing and that I was actually scared.

3) I should have seen the red flags from my wife earlier and just should have left her alone. Something I did must have set her off (still not sure what).

4) I really don't show my appreciation as much as I should, but these are the kinds of things we are working on in therapy

&lt;p&gt;4) I really don&amp;#39;t show my appreciation as much as I should, but these are the kinds of things we are working on in therapy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be 100% honest I don&amp;#39;t feel as if I am in a safe environment, but I don&amp;#39;t know how best to handle this.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"UPDATE: Wow, I didn't think that I'd get so many responses...Thank you. I tried to reply to as much as I could but it got really long.

Since everyone has been so kind and interested in my post, I thought that I'd give a short update after talking to my husband last night.

1. He's not gay. I asked him gently, as if he were, I'd be supportive anyway. But he was offended that I asked that and he says that he's definitely not gay. Now I wonder if I made it worse cause it may have affected his self-confidence even more...

2. He's not having an affair. There's literally no time in his life to have an affair and he's devoted to our family. This, i didn't even ask him (Thank God I didn't). 

3. He's not using porn. 

4. He's unhealthy, not obese. He looks healthy on the outside. But his blood pressure, cholesterol level and liver enzymes are all messed up. So is his testosterone level. He's gotten on clomid about a week ago to raise his testosterone level.

5. He thinks I'm crazy lol. He says that I needs to stop obsessing over our sex life, and I need to stop listening to reddit comments lol, and stop reading articles on it, and stop looking for answers cause sometimes in life, there's just always isn't an answer. In his words, our sex life has room to be worked on, but it's normal and a common issue that all marriages have. I got a little upset (actually, very upset) and asked him where he gets this idea that this is normal for marriages. I told him that many marriages get divorced over something like this. Also told him that I'm not looking for a way out, but I desperately want answers. 

He says I have selective memory and can't remember the good times we had sex and only remembers the bad ones. I don't know, maybe this is true. But he also thinks that if someone were to ask him how our sex life is, he'd say its good. I'd say that it's pretty bad. Basically, what he remembers as being good, and what I remember as being good is different. I think he thinks that if I have an orgasm, it counts as being good. But having orgasm using a vibrator before we have sex to get wet and unload the pressure off of him during sex, doesn't count as good sex to me. Also, when I was younger, I was just naturally hornier cause we had sex maybe once or twice a month and he didn't need to do much to find me wet and desperate for him. He felt like the man cause I was horny for him by default due to lack of sex. Now that we are scheduling sex twice a week, and my pregnancy hormones are making me feel a bit different, and with the baggage of knowledge that he's been using porn for the past 4 1/2 years instead of having sex with me is on my mind, I'm more insecure and I can't be mentally turned on unless he actually puts some effort into it. 

He feels damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. If he does have sex with me, he feels hopeless cause I won't be satisfied with his performance. I keep telling him that it's not his performance that turns me on but the foreplay that gets me going, knowing that he wants me, desires me and finds me attractive is what I'm looking for, that my pleasure is a turn on for him. But that's too much work for him, literally. He feels damned if he doesn't since I'll resent him for not having sex with me. 

I asked him if it's me, if he's just not attracted to my body, the way I look. And he blew up at me, since I keep going back to this. He says that it has nothing to do with me. I mean, that's still pretty insulting, in my opinion. How can it not have anything to do with me if he's having sex with me? I said ""Well if your ex gfs didn't have a problem turning you on, and I'm having a hard time, then I can't help but feel that it has something to do with me"". He said 1. He was younger, so his testosterone was higher. 2. He didn't have the pressure of being responsible for a family. 3. He's in the biggest project of his career and his work is stressing him out than he's ever been stressed out. I give him that, he is under a lot of pressure at work. But this was an ongoing issue before the project. And it's not like this project is going to close in the next few months, it's going to be open for the next few years, with MORE intensity. Throw in a baby, it's like telling me our sex life will be a death sentence for him. His testosterone isn't going to get better with age, it'll get worse.  

I feel more hopeless today than I did yesterday. The fact that he thinks that this is normal and not a big deal makes me feel invalidated. He says that the pressure I put on our sex life makes him not want to have sex. His solution is that he needs to be less selfish in bed and be a better lover. But he's said that before, but he can't help it if it's just a chore for him. I told him sex is supposed to be MUTUALLY enjoyable, it's supposed to be fun, it's supposed to make our bond and intimacy deeper. He knows all of that but his brain is just selfish in bed. He doesnt like kissing me because he has deviated septum (which he got surgery for) and can't breathe. He can't finger me cause he has carpal tunnel (But when he plays PC games, no problem). He doesn't go down on me cause he finds it weird and awkward, doesn't like the taste or smell, and it hurts his neck. He doesn't like playing with my breasts cause laying on his side hurts his back. He doesn't like role play cause he thinks its weird and awkward. He doesn't like talking dirty, spanking, handcuffs, blindfolds, edging, you name it, he doesn't like it. 

But he enjoys receiving oral. He likes me playing with his penis. He likes me in lingerie and stockings. He likes toys used on him. 

It's just so one sided. And not only does he try to get out of doing things that turns me on, when he does do it, it feel SOOOOOOOO forced and fake, that it's like forget itttt. Just don't touch me. 

But I'm telling you. Outside of the bedroom, he is the BEST husband ever. He's thoughtful, kind, considerate, patient, sweet, affectionate, gives me non sexual kisses, grabs my butt, makes sex jokes, we go on dates 3-4 times a week, hold hands, cuddle and hug, etc. etc. , you'd think that we have a picture perfect marriage. 

Anyway. I thought I'd give part 2 of my post. Thanks. 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

My husband and I are in our mid 30s, 5 years in with a baby on the way. We’ve had deadbedroom issues from the beginning but recently have been working with a counselor to fix it before the baby comes. I’ve gotten pretty depressed about it before the counseling but through counseling, we have been having scheduled nights for sex and he’s gotten tested for low testosterone and started on clomid to raise his testosterone level. I bought us toys to spice it up, suggested different things we can do in the bedroom, etc. and while it’s been a trial and error thing, I’m discouraged that it’s such an effort for him, a chore that he’s doing for me, for the sake of our marriage since I’m making it into a thing. For him, he says our sex life isn’t that bad. For me, it’s heartbreaking. 

Yesterday, during our scheduled sex night, he was “trying” to do foreplay...basically no kissing, play with my breasts for 3 seconds on each side cause I tell him that I like that, and then trying to spread my non existent juice over my lips so that he can stick it in. It’s been this way for a long time, but last night I had to just tell him that I wasn’t at all turned on. He asked me what to do, so I told him that I want to feel interesting to him, to feel attractive and desirable. He said that I’m too complicated. Then he said frankly, my pregnant body doesn’t turn him on at all. The fact that I’m carrying his child makes him feel uncomfortable with having sex with me. I was crushed. I felt sexy. I felt like the changes in my body was a beautiful thing...a wonder. But anyway...this is especially sad for me cause I feel like it’s always one thing or another with him when it comes to our sex life. He’s too tired, he’s got a headache, not horny...

For me, of course there’s a physical need aspect of it, but I feel so rejected, lonely, undesirable and ignored by him. It’s depressing. Other than our sexual incompatibility, our relationship is pretty darn good. We are affectionate, go on weekly dates, meet up for lunch during the week, talk all the time together, love is there. 

But I’m just kinkier than he is, he’s not into anything I like, and I like variety of things. For example, I said why don’t we try to do role play and he says “how do you do that? Hi my name is?” Tried to walk him trough that but that was a fail. Told him I like to be spanked and he says that’s weird. I said I need to be mentally turned on, maybe try talking dirty to me, and he laughed and made a poop joke. I told him I like feeling sexual, that it was a big part of who I am. And he said he doesn’t like feeling that way at all. SO, we are sexually incompatible. 

Now what? I don’t want a divorce. I can’t imagine having an open relationship. Definitely no affairs...I am trying to accept that it is what it is and we have worked on it but it’s not something you can really fix as it’s a difference in how his brain and my brain works...

Are other marriages like this? Is this a common thing and we all just learn to live with it? Can you still have a happy and fulfilling marriage with a sexually incompatible spouse? Do you over time get used to it and not get depressed over it?

,Marriage,"My husband and I are living separately right now until we find a house. He is staying with a friend that he met last year. His friend has a girlfriend that lives there as well. There has been a few things that have bothered me starting with her texting him asking him if he's okay with certain things for dinner, her texting him saying don't forget your balls in my car LOL (our kids play football..he drives with them to football), him telling her dont  forget (her sons) Jersey her saying i wont and him responding ""you better not"" 
To the most recent 
I was there one day hanging out and she had mentioned she wanted a robe about a week later I was there hanging out and she put the robe on and came downstairs and out of the blue I found out that my husband purchased this robe for her as well as purchased the guy a pair of shorts. I was very upset because I feel a robe is a very personable item my husband should not be buying for a woman. He says it's out of being nice and there's no other intentions behind it.

I was there one day hanging out and she had mentioned she wanted a robe about a week later I was there hanging out and she put the robe on and came downstairs and out of the blue I found out that my husband purchased this robe for her as well as purchased the guy a pair of shorts. I was very upset because I feel a robe is a very personable item my husband should not be buying for a woman. He says it&amp;#39;s out of being nice and there&amp;#39;s no other intentions behind it.

,Marriage,"Posting because I need some perspective on a weird situation. My fiance (M39) and I (F33) have a new small business together, and we're treading water for the most part but it's not profitable yet. We have our own personal bank accounts but share the company bank account. Apart from the business he gets some disability and I make a little at a side hustle. We have agreed to try to take as little as possible from the business for now. I look after the bills, idk what he uses his disability for besides the cable bill which we have strictly for him. 

I do the bookkeeping for the business and have asked him to please let me know when he wants to make a purchase (he uses the business account for small personal purchases pretty regularly) so I can account for it and keep us from overdrawing. He chronically ignores this agreement and I don't find out about the purchase until I check out the online account.

Today I asked to borrow $10.

,Marriage,"It's been almost 15 years.

We've been through so much. More bad than good.

His addictions, his abandonment of me and his child. I moved out and had an affair.

This asshole came back and sobered up (for 6 years now) when he realized I was with someone else. I've left him 4 times over the addictions to pills, pot and booze.

He hurt us bad for the first half of the marriage. I kicked him out when he refused to work. I left when I got an eviction notice because our rent money was spent on drugs and alcohol.


Why he got back with me? I'll never know.

But when we did get back together, I forgave and didn't bring up the past. He reminds me, every fight, that I was sleeping with someone else.

He also came to a crazy ass idea that I slept with someone in our house. He had a falling out with a co-worker and this guy (whom I've never even met) sent  my husband a gif of a woman sucking some guy off (her face was covered by hair) after him accusing me for 6 months that I was a whore, I finally showed him a reverse Google search that it wasn't me, it was a gif that was someone else (showed him the rest of the gif, it showed her face)

He STILL believes it was me and claims I had someone in the bed room.


No matter what I say and do, he will always treat me like garbage for the mistake I made. Nevermind the hurt and pain he brought us through, nevermind he would go through weeks and days at a time not talking to me or checking to see if his son was okay.

I don't want to be married. I want a divorce. I can't go on the rest of my life being accused of something I didn't do and being treated like shit because we disagree on things.

Last night we had an awful fight. I tried to bring up something that bothered me and he got so angry at me for having a problem about a fight we had last week. He didn't talk to me and I didn't talk to him - but yet I was the one ignoring him.

He called me trash, he told me I was a bad wife, a coward, he would always see me as a whore and always accuses me of having an affair with my coworkers.

I called him a jerk, abusive, and I regret the day I ever met him.


We hate each other. My life is hell. I have no where to go. I have no friends of family. I told him I want a divorce, he became irate and crazy.

He said as soon as I leave he's going to burn the house down.

I don't understand why he wants to be married if he hates me so much. I don't understand why I'm the bad guy for saying let's end this.

What am I supposed to do?? If I stay, he'll always claim I'm having an affair and never let me move past my mistakes, he is a very mean and nasty person. He doesn't ever want to talk about the problems in our marriage or our feelings, he says I thrive on fighting with him, I told him I don't and that I just want to talk things out. Calmly.

 I feel like I cannot communicate with him at all. 


What do I do? I make $14 an hour, two kids and a car that doesn't belong to me. How do I get support to leave? Should I stay?",t2_4l9caspg,False,,0,False,Terrible Marriage - Advice Desperately Needed,[],r/Marriage,False,6,,0,,False,t3_dbdnuv,False,dark,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,self,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1569887924.0,text,6,,text,self.Marriage,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been almost 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been through so much. More bad than good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His addictions, his abandonment of me and his child. I moved out and had an affair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This asshole came back and sobered up (for 6 years now) when he realized I was with someone else. I&amp;#39;ve left him 4 times over the addictions to pills, pot and booze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hurt us bad for the first half of the marriage. I kicked him out when he refused to work. I left when I got an eviction notice because our rent money was spent on drugs and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why he got back with me? I&amp;#39;ll never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when we did get back together, I forgave and didn&amp;#39;t bring up the past. He reminds me, every fight, that I was sleeping with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also came to a crazy ass idea that I slept with someone in our house. He had a falling out with a co-worker and this guy (whom I&amp;#39;ve never even met) sent  my husband a gif of a woman sucking some guy off (her face was covered by hair) after him accusing me for 6 months that I was a whore, I finally showed him a reverse Google search that it wasn&amp;#39;t me, it was a gif that was someone else (showed him the rest of the gif, it showed her face)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He STILL believes it was me and claims I had someone in the bed room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what I say and do, he will always treat me like garbage for the mistake I made. Nevermind the hurt and pain he brought us through, nevermind he would go through weeks and days at a time not talking to me or checking to see if his son was okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to be married. I want a divorce. I can&amp;#39;t go on the rest of my life being accused of something I didn&amp;#39;t do and being treated like shit because we disagree on things.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"first post, throw away for reasons.

I (mid-40s) have always adored my wife (early-50s), she tells me that she knows that but now it isn't enough.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago we were in what I thought was the best time of our marriage. I thought it was wonderful. I think she did as well. We were having a blast together. Then I made a mistake, I said something unintentionally while we were talking in bed one night about a sensitive topic that was insensitive, cruel and touched on some of her past (before me) trauma. It was a tongue in cheek comment because I was distracted by the conversation we had just had which was unrelated to us but very upsetting.  Since that night, nothing has been the same. She said it brought up all of the old things she has harbored against me in the early years of our marriage. We have been together over 15 years but the first 10 years of our marriage was challenging. I lead myself with pride instead of love and for about the second half of that 10 years I was taking some medication that was really changing my personality. We were struggling with some behavior issues with our two children and it was rough. We stopped doing family things because it was so unpleasant for so many reasons. I am responsible for some of it and I know that. About 5 or so years ago though I saw the error of my ways and started leading my life with love instead of pride. I also got off the medication once I realized it was the cause of some of our stresses. Our relationship improved between each other and our children. It wasn't perfect but it was better and she recognized my progress and seemed to appreciate it. At least, until that night a few months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I read the book the 5 love languages and asked her to read it too. She started to but it seemed to bring all of the trauma associated with our early marriage and family issues has come back and she's basically said she's not sure she can forgive me for my part in those problems. My hope was that once she read it we could perhaps read it together but so far that hasn't been possible. Since that time, and it's been a few months ago she basically wants nothing to do with me. We are robots in the house together and if I am home for too long a time period she will leave and go somewhere else. We have in the past done some couples counseling and tried to for this problem but our normal guy who she really likes is too booked and can't see us regularly. He also suggested that we both need to do a little individual therapy and then try to come back to couples.  I've seen a therapist and feel pretty fair about where I am at. I understand the problems of our past, I understand how what I said was so bad for her. At the same time though she's cut me off from all love and affection. I get a kiss good night and a kiss hello and goodbye but knowing that I can't have anything more than that causes me pain but I don't want to give up all I seem to have left. I honestly don't know how to positively interact with her because everything I do is met with anger and resentment.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a lot of hostility between us right now, I'm feeling hurt that I'm totally cut off from love and she is not sure she can forgive me. That also leads me to wonder, 'what if she can't?' Does that mean we're done? I hope not, it isn't what I want. I'm not, nor have I ever been a perfect husband or father but I try in the moment and I am working on being a better one. I don't want to paint the picture that I'm perfect, I'm not. My wife isn't either of course.  We used to have little moments in passing in the house, we would touch and kiss and hug each other. Our children were disgusted by it and we thought it was wonderful. All of that is gone now and I lay awake at night wondering where we will end up. It's affected my health, my mood, my job performance and it is affecting her as well.",t2_4p0pn3g4,False,,0,False,I hope it's just a rough time and not the end,[],r/Marriage,False,6,,0,,False,t3_db36s8,False,dark,,public,4,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,self,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1569829387.0,text,6,,text,self.Marriage,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;first post, throw away for reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I (mid-40s) have always adored my wife (early-50s), she tells me that she knows that but now it isn&amp;#39;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago we were in what I thought was the best time of our marriage. I thought it was wonderful. I think she did as well. We were having a blast together. Then I made a mistake, I said something unintentionally while we were talking in bed one night about a sensitive topic that was insensitive, cruel and touched on some of her past (before me) trauma. It was a tongue in cheek comment because I was distracted by the conversation we had just had which was unrelated to us but very upsetting.  Since that night, nothing has been the same. She said it brought up all of the old things she has harbored against me in the early years of our marriage. We have been together over 15 years but the first 10 years of our marriage was challenging. I lead myself with pride instead of love and for about the second half of that 10 years I was taking some medication that was really changing my personality. We were struggling with some behavior issues with our two children and it was rough. We stopped doing family things because it was so unpleasant for so many reasons. I am responsible for some of it and I know that. About 5 or so years ago though I saw the error of my ways and started leading my life with love instead of pride. I also got off the medication once I realized it was the cause of some of our stresses. Our relationship improved between each other and our children. It wasn&amp;#39;t perfect but it was better and she recognized my progress and seemed to appreciate it. At least, until that night a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the book the 5 love languages and asked her to read it too. She started to but it seemed to bring all of the trauma associated with our early marriage and family issues has come back and she&amp;#39;s basically said she&amp;#39;s not sure she can forgive me for my part in those problems. My hope was that once she read it we could perhaps read it together but so far that hasn&amp;#39;t been possible. Since that time, and it&amp;#39;s been a few months ago she basically wants nothing to do with me. We are robots in the house together and if I am home for too long a time period she will leave and go somewhere else. We have in the past done some couples counseling and tried to for this problem but our normal guy who she really likes is too booked and can&amp;#39;t see us regularly. He also suggested that we both need to do a little individual therapy and then try to come back to couples.  I&amp;#39;ve seen a therapist and feel pretty fair about where I am at. I understand the problems of our past, I understand how what I said was so bad for her. At the same time though she&amp;#39;s cut me off from all love and affection. I get a kiss good night and a kiss hello and goodbye but knowing that I can&amp;#39;t have anything more than that causes me pain but I don&amp;#39;t want to give up all I seem to have left. I honestly don&amp;#39;t know how to positively interact with her because everything I do is met with anger and resentment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of hostility between us right now, I&amp;#39;m feeling hurt that I&amp;#39;m totally cut off from love and she is not sure she can forgive me.

,Marriage,"Long post alert. First-time poster. So please bear with the verbose language.

I am 37F married to my husband (41M) for 11 years. We have a 4 year old child. We have had a difficult relationship partly due to our difference in backgrounds and partly due to our personalities. His family is ultra-orthodox while mine is more liberal. He is outgoing and an extrovert while I am more of a homebody and an introvert.

I had severe postpartum depression after the birth of my child mostly because of my husband's pressure to breastfeed my son and partly because of the lack of family support. It was a grand failure because my child simply wouldn't latch and no amount of coaxing would convince the little one otherwise. My husband blamed me for this comparing me to other moms who ""made that extra effort"" and were bf-ing their kids while I spiraled more into depression. I had to quit working and stay at home just to keep my sanity intact. 3 months after birth he was back on my case this time about going back to work. After a couple of miserable attempts including an on-site interview where I was sent home just 20 minutes of chat at an onsite interview, I decided enough I've had enough and decided to stay at home much to his chagrin.

I was suicidal at one point when I finally managed to be switch doctors and be on level footing thanks to a good advice and medication. But my husband constantly blames me for anything that's inconvenient or wrong. Some examples include -

1. We had installed low-flush toilets when we first bought our house but now he blames me for taking ""these steps for water conservation"" as he has to flush twice. It's silly. At least I think it is. But his constant blame game gets on my already frayed nerves and demotivates me especially at a time when I need some confidence.
2. Our toddler likes my husband more mostly because my husband never says no to him. I am the disciplinarian trying to raise him within certain boundaries. My husband makes it a point to remind me it's all because of the time he had spent with him as a kid while I was wallowing in depression. And this hurts. Big time.
3. In spite of being an introvert, I do make an effort to socialize especially with my husband's friends. He wants to do an ""activity"" or invite them to our place all the time. While I am okay with this, the bulk of the housework and cooking falls on my shoulders as my husband ""has to look after our kid"". When I point out to him that it's time we got invited rather than being the hosts all the time, I get blamed for ""isolating our family"" because of my introvert attitude.
4. I find any outings tired because I have to plan everything from packing to food while my husband books the hotel and plans the itinerary. I have to undertake every child-related decision, small or large, and I find it overwhelming. He did take him for a 2-3 day trip alone and boasted how he could do it all by himself.
5. I take care of our kid every day from feeding, dressing to dropping him off/picking him up from school. These days I use the small window of child-free time to search for jobs, schedule interview calls etc. When my husband comes back from work, our child just latches on to him. According to my husband, it's because I don't spend enough time with him. And it's true. I am so caught up with just the basic responsibilities of looking after a child that I haven't had the energy to bond fully with him.
6. I have tried a variety of ways to keep my mind occupied because I didn't want unwanted thoughts. Gardening has helped. I go through the motions of cooking because one, I like to spend as little time in the kitchen as possible and two, no matter what I cook, my husband isn't pleased. And since our kid likes to spend time more with my husband, my husband make it a point to mention how little time he has to do any kind of housework or help me But that I can find time to take care of my responsibilities all because our kid ""gives me the downtime"".
7. I am the IKEA furniture setup person, the WiFi router setup person, the garden-shed setup person, shopping for home and child, cleaning, cooking etc. I set up our child's crib when I was 7 months pregnant. I basically handle everything except not bringing finances to the table. It's not as if I am completely worthless. But since I don't contribute to our living expenses, anything I do is worthless in my husband's eyes. It's simply not enough.

There are many more such examples. They might seem very petty and trivial. But they get me down enough to end up in tears daily and get depressed about my life.

I am tired of constantly fighting and blaming. I feel like as if I am on the receiving end of mental abuse but with no help. I need to be focused enough to get a job. I want a divorce. Am I wrong in wanting this? My tired brain keeps rationalizing that my son needs his Father but not at the expense of my sanity and confidence.

Although, for my particular instance, I should give some background. My wife and I have been together for seven years, married for two of those. 
Life was good for us for a long time

Now, whenever I am in the same room with her, she literally cannot go 20 minutes without asking/telling me to do something. Seriously 20 minutes. 

I cook dinner 5 out of 7 days a week and do the dishes minimum 4 out of 7 days a week. I also run the dog and clean up after myself daily.  

As much as I would like to paint myself as the perfect husband, in far from it. I procrastinate, I drink too much sometimes, I am constantly fucking up, through no fault of hers, yet no matter how hard I try to better myself, it seems as though she never sees it, or even realizes the changes in trying to make. 

The career she is in is stressful, as is mine. Although for the past year or so it’s been difficult to find a common ground. She is in a job that has her at a computer all day, and mine is physical labour all day. 
As easy as it is for me to say “she sits on her ass” etc, she does not. She says the same of me to others. 


Yet, when I get home at 4:15pm, I’ve already taken the pooch for a run (no kids yet), started dinner, and taken out either the garbage or recycling (whichever requires), 99% of the time she comes in the door, sets her things down, then asks me to do some other task. 

I fell in love with this woman because of her drive and ambition, her caring nature and the way she carries herself. 

For me, however it’s reached a point where I need a solution to this issue, or I am going to have to leave, as the stress is not worth it.
I know deep down she wants what is best for me, but no matter what I do, nothing changes. 
I’ve brought this up to her; saying how much it bothers me, makes me want to do less around the house, makes me feel worthless etc. Yet nothing changes.

,Marriage,"*Updated*

We had a pretty ugly fight today where she said she doesn't love me anymore and doesn't want to do this anymore, and talked about how to start splitting assets. It started because I questioned charges for her last 2 meals out on a card we don't use. She said I was being unsupportive and petty, and it went downhill from there.  I am sleeping on the couch for the first time in 10+ years, and plan to set up a discreet, but comfortable sleeping arrangement to keep the kids out of the loop for now. Neither of us has told anyone, and I'm holding out hope that is a positive sign. 

Part of me feels better for knowing exactly where we stand, but the rest of me hurts for our lost love, for our children, and for the life that we have built. I didn't see this coming and hope like hell that for the sake of all of this a separation is the right answer. 

*Original Post
My (37M) wife (33F) and I have been married for ten years and have two kids, 8 and 5. She stayed home up until last year, and did some very part time swim coaching. 

She got a job as a head swim coach at a large school in May, and between home time, pool time, and time with her assistant coach (22M) now works 50+ hours a week. I have taken on dinner 7x week, kids from 6p on weekdays (I put them to bed) and all weekends (most homework, meals, discipline, snacks)
 and the Babysitter covers them 2-6 weekdays until I'm home from work. 

She spends hours with her assistant coach on Tuesday and Thursday after practice/meets for dinner, happy hour and talking about the team and planning. They also text back and forth throughout most days, and have at least one long call per week. I think that's excessive, but try to be supportive. My therapist and I agree that they probably are not romantic, but are definitely best friends and have crossed several boss/colleague boundaries when it comes to things they talk about and time spent together. It is really hard for me to experience this, and she is angry with me because of it.

There is an upcoming travel meet and we fought a week ago because I wasn't comfortable with them carpooling the day of. She told me a few days later that the swimmers were going up the night before so they could do a dinner and not rush the day of. I offered to come with the kids to do a family thing with the team, bring the kids to the meet (and handle them in the stands) and then do something as a family that night. She said no because she doesn't know what to expect and needs to be focused on the team. I wasn't thrilled, but I understand (I travel for business too). 

Yesterday we were having a good day, interacting, family dinner, planning the weekend and as I am wiping the counters she tells me the hotel she found is suites only which means that all of the girls can go in one room. Then she asks what my thoughts are on her and the assistant coach sharing a suite, where he would sleep on the couch. 

I said that is a boundary that I am not ok with, and a professional boundary that she should not cross. She said it is common for coed coaches to do this and that I am being rediculous for being jealous of a 22 y.o man child. I told her to think of anyone in our group of friends that would be cool with it, and she said it's not relevant. 

I dropped (maybe good maybe bad) what my therapist and I have concluded about them being best friends and that I feel replaced as her and she said first we are dead wrong but then later that I ""let myself be replaced"" and that being jealous about this is pathetic. 

Am I the asshole? Whether a marriage is strong or rough, is sleeping in the same hotel alone a bad idea? Even if nothing happens, night and morning routines are intimate, and the swimmers/parents will know as well. I would love to know other opinions.

&lt;p&gt;We had a pretty ugly fight today where she said she doesn&amp;#39;t love me anymore and doesn&amp;#39;t want to do this anymore, and talked about how to start splitting assets. It started because I questioned charges for her last 2 meals out on a card we don&amp;#39;t use. She said I was being unsupportive and petty, and it went downhill from there.  I am sleeping on the couch for the first time in 10+ years, and plan to set up a discreet, but comfortable sleeping arrangement to keep the kids out of the loop for now. Neither of us has told anyone, and I&amp;#39;m holding out hope that is a positive sign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me feels better for knowing exactly where we stand, but the rest of me hurts for our lost love, for our children, and for the life that we have built. I didn&amp;#39;t see this coming and hope like hell that for the sake of all of this a separation is the right answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Original Post
My (37M) wife (33F) and I have been married for ten years and have two kids, 8 and 5. She stayed home up until last year, and did some very part time swim coaching. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She got a job as a head swim coach at a large school in May, and between home time, pool time, and time with her assistant coach (22M) now works 50+ hours a week. I have taken on dinner 7x week, kids from 6p on weekdays (I put them to bed) and all weekends (most homework, meals, discipline, snacks)
 and the Babysitter covers them 2-6 weekdays until I&amp;#39;m home from work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She spends hours with her assistant coach on Tuesday and Thursday after practice/meets for dinner, happy hour and talking about the team and planning. They also text back and forth throughout most days, and have at least one long call per week. I think that&amp;#39;s excessive, but try to be supportive. My therapist and I agree that they probably are not romantic, but are definitely best friends and have crossed several boss/colleague boundaries when it comes to things they talk about and time spent together. It is really hard for me to experience this, and she is angry with me because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"My husband (32m) and I (29f) have been married for 6 months, and owned a home together for around 3 years (mortgage in my name). Throughout our whole relationship we've pretty much always made the same amount of money, and now I believe we should be in quite a comfortable spot with our combined incomes being over 100k per year.

However, my husband is financially inept. I take care of almost all our bills, and they're almost all in my name, he is only responsible for his credit card (when we joined our finances I made him get this to build up his credit) and car bill (6 year loan that he took out before he met me). He ""forgot"" to pay his CC for a bit (which I thought had no balance since we paid off his prior balance with wedding money) and his credit took a HUGE hit. The only reason I know is because we're supposed to go away in November I kept asking him to sign up for a new card that gives 250 back if you spend 1k in the first 90 days.  We split wedding gifts, some went to debt, some went to savings, and some is left over; I figured sign up, get the $250 back, and then pay it off right away with the leftover. Anyway, he got rejected because his other card was over due.

This pissed me off for a lot of reasons: 1. Because to move forward with my plan for this vacation I had to apply for the card in my name. 2. Because anytime I've made a mistake (occasional slip of paying something late (tbh it's been a really hard year for me and I have completely forgot things a couple times) I have been completely honest. He fully lied and tried to hide it from me. I have been basically scraping by trying to aggressively pay stuff off (dental, vet, laptop needed after I got laid off) my credit score is real high right now and I feel like he let it all be undone by having his take a huge hit.

He just doesn't get it, and I don't want this to be a strain on our relationship. I often feel (and think he does too) that I should just take care of everything and just give him an allowance. At the same time, we've pretty much always agreed we'd want to have kids after a couple of year married spent traveling etc, and, morbidly enough, I always like to consider how others would carry on if I got hit by a bus or something. I feel like it's not my place to teach a 32 year old how to pay bills (looking at you MIL) but at the same if we have kids, I want both of us to be equally capable of caring for them. There's also so many great things about our relationship that I want this to be a nonissue.

As hard as this is for me to say, i know our marriage is over. In gentle language through your own fear you were able to tell me that you love and care for me but can not be physically intimate with me any longer.

You’ve  met someone that makes you feel a way that I can not and while initially I was feeling the “why me” and “this cant be happening” to hear your truth has set us both free. I love and respect the person that you are and I will be cheering you on as you become the person you were meant to be.

We have a very good life. We are healthy have money. The money comes from my husband he works and make a lot of money. I stopped working when I got pregnant with our first, I wasn’t sure but he told me if I wanted to I don’t have to work. I choose that route. And it wasn’t really a problem until lately. 
He is a wonderful family man loves his daughters and does a lot of daddy stuff and can help with a baby no problem. 
The big problem is communication. Yes we have a good life and not much to complain about but sometimes there r still things that come up. He complains about work, shoulder pain, and many other life related things and I always listen.
On the other hand I can’t complain. At all. As soon as I say something that is mildly complaining or venting (and not in an angry tone just kind of as a conversation to discuss not even a problem with him) he gets angry at me and shuts me down and walks away saying he doesn’t want to hear complaining.

,Marriage,"Hey all Redditers, 

at the moment I am dealing with very frustrating times in my life. 
I am currently 25 years old and my husband is 35. We are married since last december and currently expecting our first child - I am 8 months pregnant. 
My husband does not seem to want me phsically. During my pregnancy we had sex less than 10 times in total, and now I realize, that since we live together, we were not having sex very often. When we were just dating (we had long distance relationship, but we managed to meet at least every 2-3 weeks) we were having sex each time we met and it was great and very satisfying. 

I am young, slim and attractive woman that cares for herself and even I am 8 months pregnant, I did not gain any extra weight, except the belly which I have very tiny. I am still dressing feminine, keeping my hair and skin nice and wear a little of make up.
I know, that he loves me a lot and he would do anything for me, but it really kills my self-confidence that I am just getting simple kisses on lips in the morning and in the evening when we meet at home after work. When I am trying to initiate something, he seems like he is not noticing (or he is ignoring?), the same happens when I try to write him something during the day, indicating that I want him or I send him some cute picture of me (which I do not really do often, so it is supposed to be something ""extra"", if you know what I mean, for sure I am not spamming him with pics of myself). 

This week I became very frustrated, because we were watching a serial in the evening and I started to touch him and after some time I realized, that he is not reacting and he is actually asleep. When we go to bed in the evening, he just turns to his side of the bed and falls asleep, while I am just crying disappointed, hoping for some intimacy. 
If I start to discuss this, in my opinion serious problem, and I am talking about it in a very sensitive way without drama, he barely speaks and answers my questions. He says that in his opinion everything is normal. Then he is just upset for the whole next day, I do not get any answers and we do not come to any solution. 

It is not a sleeping disorder, because he does not really need to sleep much and in the morning he wakes up early with no problem. He does not look stressed from work. We have more than enough money, so there are also no worries of this kind. I also do not think it is a low testosterone problem, he makes a lot of sports and he is very masculine. 
I even mentioned, that if there is now someone who he likes more than he likes me, I would understand it, because I know these things are happening all the time, but he refused that too. 

I simply do not understand, where can be a problem. When we met, I considered him very open when it comes to sex and I really felt wanted, but now even we have sex, it feels kind of mechanical, with no contact or harmony. 

Do you have any ideas what to do in this case? Will it somehow resolve itself or should I try to speak about it with him more?

,Marriage,"My (35F) husband (37M) recently shattered my trust.

Last month my dear, sweet husband had a mental breakdown and asked me to move out, claiming he hadn't loved me in nearly a year. I was beyond broken, as I hadn't noticed anything negative in our relationship. We have been married for 15 years. We have always been that couple other people claim to envy. Affectionate, loving, happy...but here he was, telling me he hadn't loved me in a year, wanted me to leave. I begged him to tell me if there had been someone else, he said no. He promised his entire family there was no one else. (Even after his mother assured him if he wanted someone else she would support that because she wants him to be happy.) 

I truly don't believe he had an affair.

Well, we were only separated 4 days before he agreed to meet me for lunch and said he didn't want a divorce and wanted me to come back home.

It's been about a month and a half, he has now finally been treated for his unchecked depression, and he is doing and saying all the right things...but I just can't seem to get the sound of his voice saying ""I don't love you anymore,"" out of my head. Sometimes when he kisses me, my heart breaks.

Everytime he seems funny about me having access to his phone, I don't think he's having an affair...I'm afraid he is researching divorce or looking for a lawyer.

I've spoken to him about this numerous times. He's been excellent about letting me get out my emotions and holding me when I cry...and he says he will spend the rest of his life helping me get through it because it was all his fault.

(He says the depression got really bad and he didn't know what to do, and now claims he had always loved me and never stopped, but he had to push me away but regretted it immediately...the details change a little but he says it was an extremely confusing time for him and he regrets it.)

Within the last few days I told him he has broken my trust and he asked how he could rebuild it...but I don't know how.

How do I get over the fear that this will happen again? How do I trust him when he says he loves me now? How do I stop allowing myself to believe that everything is a lie?

I was led to believe the last year had been a lie, and now he says that he was lying about lying about not loving me. (Though lying isn't his term for it.)

&lt;p&gt;Last month my dear, sweet husband had a mental breakdown and asked me to move out, claiming he hadn&amp;#39;t loved me in nearly a year. I was beyond broken, as I hadn&amp;#39;t noticed anything negative in our relationship. We have been married for 15 years. We have always been that couple other people claim to envy. Affectionate, loving, happy...but here he was, telling me he hadn&amp;#39;t loved me in a year, wanted me to leave. I begged him to tell me if there had been someone else, he said no. He promised his entire family there was no one else. (Even after his mother assured him if he wanted someone else she would support that because she wants him to be happy.) &lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"First time poster. Sorry for the rant...

   I am 32. Fifteen years ago I was not the man I am today. In more ways than I can get into here. Sarah and I met each other when I was in the worst time in my life but she showed me love when I couldn't find it no matter where I looked. I was caught up in drugs and money but she didn't want any part of that. She had a boyfriend but hadn't been happy for a while but felt she couldn't leave because he provided security. As independent a woman as she was she couldn't go home because her mom died when she was 15 and had to drop out to support her emotionally paralyzed father and younger sister and found the only security she could find in a guy she stayed with for 6 years. 
   I met her right in the midst of her relationship while in the midst of my own young adult ventures of figuring myself out. I was single and amidst a legal battle. I had watched my parents marriage fall apart after my father's manic depressive episodes corrode their marriage into a tragic swingers experiment go wrong. We were both 20 and I escaped by moving out and getting a full time job and sold drugs to make ends meet while supporting my own habit masking my pain and loneliness. I wasn't the ladies man and struggled to find a date but when I met her we connected. We hung out on a few occasions and on one drunken night we made out but I couldn't get her to leave her boyfriend no matter how hard I tried. It was for the best because I ended up getting sentenced for a drug conviction to 3 years in prison of which I served 18 months and upon release I attended treatment and realized that I wasn't an addict but a dependent on certain substances which helped me cope with certain emotions. I worked on myself allot during my time in and for 6 months upon release and learned allot. I went on a few dates with a girl but nothing really happened. Then I decided to look up Sarah. 
    She was single and had been for about a year. I asked her to get together to hang out but always had an excuse not to until I showed up at her door and from there we fell in love. We were together for 6 months before I proposed. I never felt so confident and comfortable in front of anyone before her and I saw this awe of love in her eyes for me and I loved her. I got a full time job and we got an apartment together. I didn't have a problem covering all expenses at first until I realized that I couldn't afford both of us so eventually she found part time work and we tied the knot. It was a small intimate wedding that cost us nothing.
   We lived in the tiny apartment for a couple years. Until it became unbearable and found a house where we now have a mortgage. Though we would both love to have some we just don't feel the world is ideal to bring kids into so we decided against having any. 
    So you're probably wondering where this is going. We've now been living in our home for 3 years and been married for 5+ but ever since we have been together she has had a consistent habit of drinking and smoking cigarettes. Don't get me wrong, I drink occasionally like weekly on Friday nights for date night or when going out with friends every so often. The problem is she drinks 10- 20 beers daily along with smoke a pack a day+. She's not unruly or belligerent, she mainly just drinks to call her nerves/anxiety. This has always been a point of contention between us which she has constantly pledged to address but still hasn't. Though I don't love it, I understand it because we all have our vices. I used to smoke and have turned to casing vaping for the past few years because it is cheaper and seemingly less harmful (recent events aside). I don't have so much of a problem with her habit as much as I need her help to maintain our lifestyle. Between expenses, emergencies and investing for our future I can't do it on my own when her income barely covers her own habits let alone the future costs of her and our habits. When I try to confront the topic she just talks about how she's not worthy of me or says she is trying so hard to make me happy. But really it's not that I'm unhappy, it's that the math isn't adding up and I need her help to stay afloat. I'm not asking for her to quit any/everything but rather to either cut back or work more to help with the expenses. But she takes it so much to heart like I'm telling her that needs to be better for me. She told me tonight that she's just getting in my way and should just quit holding me back.

Greetings All,

I am in an international relationship with my wife that I absolutely love. We dated for around 2 years and have been married for a little more than one year. I work full time and she is still a student at university. I pay for all of our bills, bought her a car, and even pay for her college tuition. At the time we started dating, I was unemployed with only basically a computer to my name, so I know she loved me for who I was and hopefully still am.

Over the past several months, I can literally see our relationship heading in separate directions and I don't know what to do. She has become very controlling of our relationship, getting angry with me if I watch certain movies, got angry with me about drinking a Gatorade during my soccer match (sugar), does not allow the AC on in the apartment during 100+ degree temperature, and even got salty when she caught me studying the Bible. She has a completely zero sex drive now, maybe once a month we make love, with me having to initiate it every time. She does not randomly kiss or hug me anymore which always warmed up my day.

I have supported her and encouraged her to seek health about her mental illness and get a full diagnoses on the situation, but she refuses because she ""doesn't trust western doctors."" She has become very politically active and fighting for world peace and left wing agendas, and basically forces people out of her life with people who even slightly disagrees with her. I am a Libertarian and have shift from the left and right depending on the situation, with my family being mainly conservative. My wife stated that she felt ""bullied"" due to my brother being right wing, when my wife keeps on bringing politics up around them. I know she is passionate about it but it is all she ever talks about anymore with anyone.

There is a history of her being physically abusive towards me, but I let it pass because she was suffering from what I assume to be bipolar disorder. That was several months ago and she has never physically hurt me again after I told her I wouldn't put up with that attitude. When we have small arguments here and there she always says things like ""we are not a good match"" and ""I am moving back to my country"", along with others things of that nature. I feel like I am the only one fighting for our relationship but I am starting to drown. I have been there and supported her for several months when she was going through some bad things, but when I need her she is not there. She becomes distant and tells me to ""brush it off.""

There is so much more to the story and what I am feeling but I didn't want to make it long. What do you think of what I posted? Am I being over-dramatic like she told me last night or am I just trying to work on our relationship like a normal couple? We are both young and I love her to death, but I really need help.

,Marriage,"Hi everyone. I posted earlier about my husband having secret meetups with his ex and got some really insightful responses. Spoiler, we’re still together, albeit by a thread... 

I’ve been talking with him about boundaries and he seems to think there’s nothing wrong with him regularly telling/texting his ex girlfriend that he loves her.(who he admitted he had a hard time getting over and didn’t want to break up with AND who I’ve conveniently never met.) He claims they became best friends after the breakup and she is incredibly important to him. But again, I’m his wife and I’ve never met her... yet I’ve met pretty much every one of his other close friends, male and female. 

So, I’d like some outside perspective. What is your take on telling an ex  that you dated for a year and a half and remained close with that you love her/him on a regular basis? Especially if your current SO has never met them before? 

Clarify: check out my old thread for more content to our situation... but I’m mostly curious what you think of the boundary of telling an ex you love them regularly.

Update: after reading many responses my husband came home to talk. I asked to see the texts. Beyond what I ever imagined. She’s still asking him to meet and he’s playing it off like he’s busy—no “sure let’s invite (my name)!” Her last text was last night. 

In the texts, they refer to each other as “my love” and they keep saying I miss you and he’s said recently that she is incredibly special to him among 800 other texts that includes more heart and love emojis than he ever sends me.

,Marriage,"Married in early 20s, 10 yrs, house and kid.
At start of relationship, husband and I made it Facebook official, ceremoniously logged into to update status and boom. Msg from ""her""......blah blah blah i see ur in a relationship, to hard to just be your friend so goodbye.

He maintained they had been talking but it was just for his closure. She cheated he was over it but they were friends first so he didn't see an issue. Having got his closure he said not to worry and would fall back, not reach out.

I let it go. Fast forward a year or 2 into the  marriage ( i admittedly snooped) i see they had been Facebook messaging. Benign but flirty. Lots of ""hope ur still writing, world needs ur art"" from him and ""you deserve the best, i always pray for your joy"" from her...mixed with nostalgia about  mutual friends and  funny things between them both as friends and  when they dated.....again no outright ""i miss you"" or whatever, but seemed high in flattery. He again says im bugging, i have been  cheated on so i said ok maybe its me.

They took the Facebook convo offline, periodically texted, i observed this was systematically wheneverwe were not in a good place....( in hindsight, not sure chicken or egg here....were we bad becuz he had been dreaming  about her, was he reaching out because i was not meeting his needs) I told him i don't care but wanted to know  at least when they had spoken.

He didn't hold this up and started deleting the  threads, after a couple rounds of fighting he said he wasn't doing anything wrong but deleted due to my reaction. I swore off snooping and said i wasn't gonna be that chick....but the rythm maintained. He stone walls, so we have periods of him giving me silent treatment for  offenses i have no idea i committed, not blaming...i accept  my part in the relationship issues, i am guilty of trying to prove my worth by accomplishing benchmarks i didnt set. I have been in school and busy or depressed and not always there for him. Overextending myself for family when i should have put him first...but i digress. He says he'd go silent and cold intentionally to get my attention/ vindication for making him feel ignored. During those times like clockwork he texts and calls her.

Same fight, same girl,10 years. Just learned that before i had my son she apologized for cheating and told him he was the one who got away and she fucked up. He confessed today still being mad about it as recently as  2017.

2 years ago in 2017, keeping in mind we have a special needs child, financial issues and i had just taken a promotion in a role i knew would not be healthy  but needed money. I had a boss who had it out for me and  it was a hard season. I often felt alone managing our sons diagnosis and care so cue the nervous breakdown.

I was cutting and felt like i was losing it. Crying all day, panic Attacks in waves. I check myself in knowing that  my depression was  out of control. Having passive suicidal thoughts, no plan, no intention. I knew my head was gone and i needed meds.

While i was in the ""hospital"" for a week  he visits her takes her food they eat in his car at her job. Says it was his way of letting go and that she was being a friend. He felt abandoned thinking i intended to off myself. 

Cell records show  for the next 6 months they talk daily text and calls and for literally up to 5 hours in a setting. 

He was totally full of contempt for me  and the stonewalling was as bad as me saying hello or asking him something 6 inches from his face and he would ignore me.

There are periods of no talking then weeks of texting, equally initiated by  the both of them. He never texts about me or my son but asserts she gets him and is a good friend and thats it. When i bring it up he gets defensive and  says he isn't going to  abandon her and he knows she struggles with depression and wont not be there for her. He says  she had an abortion and that was why they were in the phone so much and that they were talking about our marriage problems when he was coping with my breakdown  and  she was just lending an ear. I had asked if we could all go out if such good friends and I  don't wanna make him give that up. He texted her this and she replied ""i dont think i will ever be ready for thay"" but niw says its cuz he told her i didn't like her years back.

He texts her a lot. On my birthday he texted her at 7:35 am....first thing in the  morning. Its like bland on  the surface but i read into as attractions and  tension. I think it feels good to be needed or does something for his ego ..he denies it.

He not long ago started a  message ""hows the dopest girl in the world"" and said he doesn't know why he said that when i asked why. 
 He says all the flattery is nothing but him being nice and that if he was doing anything wrong he wouldn't let me have his password or leave his phone around.

In 2017 when we were really struggling tho he had Facebook messaged her and deleted it. The searched ""can someone see if you delete their messages"" worried she would know?!?

Im crushed...i think he's harboring feelings but admittedly dont have the greatest self esteem but this seems far from just friends given the history... am i tripping or is this an emotional affair? Or is he still in love with her? Or do i need to let it go.

We are newly doing therapy, fyi haven't broached this yet in our sessions.

Tl;dr: husband still talks to ex ( no children together) despite my anxiety/ anger over it and her revealing years back he is the one who got away. When i was at my lowest he went to see her. He talks to her every time we are not doing well but argues that she is just a friend.
What constitutes an emotional affair? Am i just being  insecure?

My husband and I have been married for 6 years and together 11.

We have survived infidelity (on my part, over 3 years ago), and loss of jobs as well as financial stress.

We currently have a 15 month old toddler who is absolutely perfect ( she is my husband's child, and the pregnancy was unplanned for those inquiring minds. The pregnancy wasn't a ""trap"").

Ever since the birth, intimacy has really dropped. I have been and still go to therapy for PPD and PPA, but I also feel like he put added pressure on me for denying him sex.

I try and explain to him that after a full day of work at a financial institution, then coming home to be mom, and putting the baby to sleep, I am just exhausted. Mentally, physically, and emotionally drained.

Every time I go to post this I end up deleting it. is not good enough, even though I praise him for being an excellent husband and father.

I show my appreciation for him by making his lunch everyday, getting him special treats at the store, asking him how his day went and actually listening,  posting about him on social media, and watching sports with him on TV when I have a minute to breathe.

I feel like he doesn't see that as enough and I think he thinks he made the wrong decision by staying with me years ago.

If I try and hold his hand or his waist or something and say how nice it is, he tells me that I've now made it awkward and ruined the moment, so I understand the feeling of rejection.

I would normally post this to one of my mom facebook groups, but I'd like insight from both men and women, and also we live in a small county where everyone knows everyone and their business.

,Marriage,"
I know the statistics, and I’ve heard horror stories from both sides. I don’t want our marriage to be one of those. My husband is beyond amazing with me, married 1 year together 6 years. I’ve been going through some rough patches these past 2 years and he has been by my side for everything. I know he’s feeling the burden because everyone does at some point.

What can I do to be the best partner for him?
I attend weekly therapy and see my psychiatrist every month. I make my mental heath a priority because I know how hard it is to be with someone who has it. I do my best to control what I can, when I can.

I’m not necessarily looking for a one quick answer, but habits I can build over time to reinforce that I love him and appreciate him and give him what he needs. 



Context: Bipolar Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, PTSD, Depression and Borderline personality Disorder.

2 year rough patch:
I had to leave teaching about 2 years ago because I could not work with my coping mechanisms while in the schools I worked for. It’s also very controversial that a teacher has a mood disorder and people assume the worst.

So I went to a coding boot camp to obtain an additional skill and then took on a Tech position until I was injured in a slip and fall accident. I now found a job that meets all my requirements to maintain a healthy work life balance, and a similar amount of pay from when I was a teacher. The biggest issue is that with Bipolar comes “risky behavior” for me, that is shopping. So with not working for almost a year out of the 2 year period and maybe making 1/2 of what I should have for awhile, the debt has piled up. 

So of course one of the bigger issues in a marriage, money is an issue. We are good now, payment plans and everything is now through debit, but it doesn’t change the consequences of these past two years.

,Marriage,"I'm really trying to be more supportive of my wife in every aspect. I want to be her cheerleader. It's just a bit difficult as I tend to try and be safe and think a lot more about my decisions while my wife is more impulsive.

I have to fight the urge to say something. Not against it... But to just be wary. An example I can give is something I just said.
Her new job has been extremely stressful and she's been pretty depressed. She vented to me and I am fully on her side as the people there seem to be insane and there's a certain group that bullies her. The people that have worked closely with her have no idea why. 
I agreed and supported w/o giving benefit of the doubt like I typically do. Especially since it's pretty clear these people are mean. 

But then she said she was going to try and go back to her previous job so she emailed her previous boss. With her feeling so down lately and alone/rejected I felt the need to just warn her that she could be turned down. I didn't want her to put all her hope on something and it not turn out and her just go further into depression. Which is her normal behavior. 

Just trying to figure out if I should just be 100% supportive whenever something like this happens and not give any of warnings of the negative outcomes I see. Or provide the warnings...

,Marriage,"Hello everyone, first time poster.

I've been with my husband for almost 10 years, married 6. We've had issues in our relationship that has been from my jealousy but it had been really bad these past few months. Recently he mentioned divorce.  He says he loves me but isn't happy. 

He recently started to talking to an old friend, one that he loved and would have chosen over me. They talked for a week before I told him to stop. I was trying to be okay with it but I just couldn't. They talked about past feelings and he said it was to set a boundary like ""this happened, this is how we felt but that isnt the case anymore and if you're speaking to me because of this, we cant go on talking"". He would tell her that he never wants to let her go. That he would rather miss out on stuff than miss out on talking to her. 

He finally admitted to me that he cares for her deeply and she is very important to him. He says that he feels drawn to her but not in the way I'm thinking. I think he still has feelings for her, feelings that were brought back because she was there when we weren't in a good place. He says it's nothing more than a friendship, that I'm too narrow minded to understand. I'm trying to understand but I can't see it that way. He wants to start speaking to her again and I dont know if I should be okay with it. I know it'll only bring problems. What should I do?

,Marriage,"DISCLAIMER

I am choosing to stay in my marriage. Just need coping tips for when I'm not with him. 


My husband had an affair with a person he spent two months trying to convince me was just a friend to help him through the toughest time he and I ever faced. I accepted the things I did to lead us there and have made the changes I need to make to ensure I do not push him there again. The affair was out of character for him and something he is ashamed of. He ended it when I discovered what was truly going on and has been an absolute prince since then. Since I confirmed it only 3 weeks ago, I am still having coping issues although it feels like our marriage is moving forward. 

My big issue is getting the feeling out of my head that he is still talking to her. He has deleted all his social media except Snapchat (my biggest concern). And even if I were to check his phone randomly, it wouldn't help my feelings because it's still so easy to hide. I understand the trust issues will be there for a while, but it's the days like today I have a harder time. 

We are leaving for a trip out of town tomorrow and he never arranged for a pet sitter like he was supposed to do. That left it to me for the last minute And I got a little bit upset with him about it. We did not fight, I just argued with him for a little bit. And then the feeling set in. The feeling that I am going to push him back to her because I got upset with him. Of course he ensured me that kind of stuff wasn't happening and that he isn't going to go back to her and that he isn't talking to her, but a small part of me is still sometimes afraid to believe it. Pretty much things are too good to be true so when they're not I get gun shy. 

For anyone that has been in this situation and decided to stay with their spouse, how do you cope with the feeling that the person might still be there? How do you cope with the feeling that something small might have messed all this up? How do you force yourself to concentrate on the good and push the bad away?

I have pretty much removed myself from everything that I could track his activity because I was becoming obsessive about it. I know it takes time to rebuild trust, especially for a person like me. But I need to be able to move on if I want this marriage to work and I need to not let these thoughts consume me just because I got upset over something. I am typically good with coping, but this is on a different level.

It is harder for me to cope because I don't feel like he suffered any consequences. I didn't kick him out of the house, I didn't leave, I'm the one dealing with all the emotional stress of it while he got the wife that he wanted. If I take the wife that he wanted away from him then he is going to think that I'm not serious about moving on. So I'm stuck in the circle of trying to give him everything he needs but still wondering.

Also, the situation that happened today is a situation that frequently happens. It was one of my big issues with him that he is supposed to be working on and this is the first time he would have been able to show me that he is serious about making the change. That made it a little bit worse for me because even though he is doing all of these wonderful amazing things it still feels like he is not willing to Do everything I need him to when I am.

,Marriage,"I (26f) and my husband (28m) have been together for almost 5 years now and married for just over 1. In the time we have been together we really only ever spent about a week apart. We moved in together after only 3 months so I have gotten use to having someone sleeping beside me. 
However recently he got a job in another city which is about an hour and a half drive from where we are currently staying. So he has decided to stay with his mom who lives in that city while I stay with my mom (were we are currently staying to save money).

,Marriage,"I hear so many couples on social media refer to each other as best friends and I always thought that was really weird. 
When the bible and the church talks about marriage, they never say that a husband and a wife should be your best friend. Adam and eve were not best friends and spouses are not met to be best friends In general. A best friend is typically someone of the same sex who you have much more in common with and who you can tell anything and be vulnerable with. But a marriage is different. Marriage involves high standards, romance and sex. You have to woo, impress and please your spouse, you must be the best and perform well in bed and if you fail to do these things then your spouse will resent you and possibly commit adultery or dump you. 
2) in a marriage there are heavy responsabily and expectations to fulfil. Specially when there is kids involved or if you and your spouse are planning to have kids. This is where the romance die but the marriage will still be hard as it's suppose to be. You discuss child rearing, bills, doctors appointments, changing shitty diapers, being woken up by screaming baby, you come home to a tired nagging depressed house wife or husband who you most likely don't make love to anymore and he/she nags at you or stress you out and criticize every little things you do and you walk on eggshells. Then there comes the part that is the hardest and the most annoying. In laws visitation. Having to deal with in laws because they want see their grand babies. 
A friendship is A lot simpler then marriage. With friends, there is no pressure to perform and be your best. Friendship is low maintenance. Friends are those who you can relax with and have a laugh and a great time. Friends don't require you to do much other then having their backs, being respectful and kind and be loyal and make time for them. Friends never ask too much and put pressure on you.

,Marriage,"Both my husband and I (26 y/o M and F) are the same age, in the same profession, and in the same sport. We are very supportive of each other and love each other very much- I could never live without this man. We have been married 2 years and together 8.

We both do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and it is our favorite thing. We are both blue belts, and have been training 5-6 days per week for the past 3 years. We both work very hard, and I have even competed in 4 tournaments and am signed up for another one next week. He hasn't competed yet, but plans to compete in the coming months. He is very good at the sport despite him not competing yet, and he would kill it in competition.

So far, every time we have gotten promoted by our coach  (belt or stripe), he has given us these promotions together. However, last night he gave a stripe to my husband and not to me and I am absolutely crushed. Like full body destroyed physically, mentally, and emotionally. I don't even feel like I can compete in my tournament next week because my head isn't in the right place now.

My husband is more skilled than me, and he 100% deserves his stripe. I am not upset at him at all, and I am very proud of him. But the overwhelming feeling of my own failure to get a stripe is preventing us from celebrating his accomplishment. He keeps saying things like ""I only got it because I'm bigger"" and ""strips/belts don't matter"" and I appreciate him trying to make me feel better, but I feel like a horrible wife. I don't want to be jealous of him, but I am. I want to be supportive and happy for him, but I can't get over my own despair.

A similar situation happened back when we were searching for our first jobs and he got one and I didn't right away.

He is better than me at most things, and I am happy to have such an amazing and skilled partner. How do I stop being so jealous?

,Marriage,"My husband texted me earlier today to tell me that he would be back at a certain time and to have the food ready by then because he was really hungry. I was missing some ingredients that I needed to make the side dish, so I told him to buy them on the way home. I got the main part of the dish ready without the chicken because I thought since I only needed to reheat it, I would do so while making the side dish; that way the chicken would still be hot and everything will be served at once. 
Well, he comes back with the ingredients, so I get in the kitchen and start prepping. In the meantime I try to make small talk and ask him if he ate lunch. He tells me yes and I proceed to ask him what food it was, to which he replied “ this conversation is inconsequential, just get the food ready”. I didn’t hear the rest of his sentence, so I peaked in the living room and asked him to repeat what he said, and he then repeats himself and say “ this conversation is pointless, I don’t know why you’re asking me this, go cook, I’m hungry”. I got pissed and told him to keep the same energy and not to talk to me after he’s done eating. He tells me to stop talking and to go cook, and I tell him in return that I can both cook and talk at the same time.

I go back to the kitchen and 2 min later, he joins me and tells me to drop everything; that he doesn’t like people that are mad at him to make him food, and that he doesn’t know what kind of stuff I can put in the food to hurt him. That angered me so much, so I stormed out of the kitchen and told him he could have cooked himself as soon as he came back. He starts yelling and asks me why I didn’t heat up the chicken , that I’m lazy etc.. I try to explain to him that it was going to take 2 min to heat it up and it would have been ready at the same time as the side dish. He tells me to shut the fuck up and I say to him to shut up as well while I go upstairs. I hear him yell downstairs and say that I’m stupid and I don’t know how to do shit. 
I came back downstairs and said to him that I was tired of his abuse and that he was a piece of shit and I threw the bowl I had in my hand.

I’m a little calm now, so I took the time to write to hear your opinions on this. I don’t understand how can things escalate so quickly. 

When we have good moments, everything is great but when it’s bad, we go through times like this. I’m fed up. One other thing is I may be pregnant and this had led me to consider the type of environment I want my child to grow up in.

My husband is a grad student and I left my job as a manager to follow him where he’s currently doing his program. We’ve been together for 4 years, married for almost three and while I told him multiple times, I don’t like the way he talks to me, he keeps saying that words are just words, and if I’m confident in who I am, no words should phase me. I just think his way of thinking is so analytical and it completely erases the human component of who we are as human beings.

,Marriage,"Reddit I need you to weigh in on my situation as an objective outside source. My wife and I married 4 1/2 years ago. And we are not doing good. 

I’d like to preface this by saying a couple things. 

Yes I can be a jerk...

Yes I struggle with pride...

Yes I did not handle every situation perfectly lovingly...

But please understand that in our first 3 years nothing happened outside of normal marriage issues and life adjustments. With that in mind please continue.

My wife was my first and only love. I had never had a girlfriend until I met her. She was my one and only. So I was totally surprised when within the first month of our marriage she was threatening divorce, and then every month after that. Sometimes she would threaten this multiple times a month or even week. Basically any time things got hard or there was an argument.

 I found this all very strange so I immediately ask her to attend counseling with me because it made no sense at all. She refused. My parents divorce always left me deeply hurt, so facing the possibility of this in my own marriage sent me into the deepest depression of my life. On top of this my wife would also physically abuse me. One time trapping me in our kitchen she kicked me and punched me anywhere you can name for about 1-2 minutes straight, as I laid there in a ball on the floor. These types of events mixed with endless arguments continued for 3 years. 

Some of you may find this next statement impossible to believe but I know others have experienced similar situations. Out of our first 3 years my wife never apologized or took personal responsibility for any of her actions. She would blame every situation, argument or issue on me. She also convinced her friends and family that this was the case. 

After years of mental and physical abuse and having my wife tell me she didn’t want to be with me, I reached a complete breaking point. Something about me changed in an instant and I haven’t been the same since. After reaching this breaking point I met a girl while on a job who had experienced an almost identical situation. She was the only person I spoke with who completely understood what I was going though. We continued to speak for about a month but stopped after my wife found out. I am still with my wife but I do not know what to do... she has never showed guilt or remorse for her actions. I love here very much but i feel as if there should be some sort of sorrow or guilt over the amount of pain she has caused. I have been trying to gauge whether or not she is a true sociopath or not. I feel like I have lost all grip on reality. I don’t know what to believe anymore. I just keep finding out thing after thing that she has lied about. She seems to be totally void of conscience.  I want to believe her... but I haven’t been able to let my guard down with her again. 

My life is in shambles and I am distant from all my friends and family. I don’t remember what normal life is like anymore. 

Would you all consider what I did an affair? 

Should I press on and make myself vulnerable again? And work on what I have?

&lt;p&gt;I found this all very strange so I immediately ask her to attend counseling with me because it made no sense at all. She refused. My parents divorce always left me deeply hurt, so facing the possibility of this in my own marriage sent me into the deepest depression of my life. On top of this my wife would also physically abuse me. One time trapping me in our kitchen she kicked me and punched me anywhere you can name for about 1-2 minutes straight, as I laid there in a ball on the floor. These types of events mixed with endless arguments continued for 3 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you may find this next statement impossible to believe but I know others have experienced similar situations. Out of our first 3 years my wife never apologized or took personal responsibility for any of her actions. She would blame every situation, argument or issue on me. She also convinced her friends and family that this was the case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of mental and physical abuse and having my wife tell me she didn’t want to be with me, I reached a complete breaking point. Something about me changed in an instant and I haven’t been the same since. After reaching this breaking point I met a girl while on a job who had experienced an almost identical situation. She was the only person I spoke with who completely understood what I was going though. We continued to speak for about a month but stopped after my wife found out. I am still with my wife but I do not know what to do... she has never showed guilt or remorse for her actions. I love here very much but i feel as if there should be some sort of sorrow or guilt over the amount of pain she has caused. I have been trying to gauge whether or not she is a true sociopath or not. I feel like I have lost all grip on reality. I don’t know what to believe anymore. I just keep finding out thing after thing that she has lied about. She seems to be totally void of conscience.  I want to believe her... but I haven’t been able to let my guard down with her again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life is in shambles and I am distant from all my friends and family. I don’t remember what normal life is like anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you all consider what I did an affair? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I press on and make myself vulnerable again? And work on what I have? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have any of you experienced similar situations?&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"My husband is a student,  he's been working on his PhD for the past few years and has more ahead.  He gets paid enough to cover rent. I make twice as much as him and have been the main provider since we've been married. It definitely weighs on me.  We have a lot of expenses,  but if budgeted right we can save a few hundred a month. I'd like to save more. He has a lot of bonus expenses that I see as extra and to him are necessities. He also has a lot of doctor appointments that he goes to several times a month (shoulder pain due to lifting) that all have copays. 

I'd like him to tutor 3-5 hours a month. To me it's an easy way to generate income with little effort on his part because he can set his hours and is super smart. 


The issue is I know he'll be sensitive about this and see it as a criticism.  I get it because we technically do make enough with out extra effort on his part. And to be honest I'm jealous about how hard I have to work and how easy he has it.  Which isn't a good mentality and I'd like advice on that too. Because it's likely that im just the problem and need to get over it.  

I moved out at 17 and had to work three jobs to put myself through school and he went from his parents supporting him to me and I just never expected to struggle with supporting him through his PhD this much.

,Marriage,"I want to go back to college winter/spring 2020; but, my fiance wants me wait until we get married. We're thinking about getting married a year from now. Waiting the full year is at the latest though. So, it's a possibility that we could get married in the summer or even late spring.

We're not having a wedding or anything, just a minister marrying us. No crazy expensive spending, just a nice quiet ceremony between the minister, me and fiance. We plan on spending our money on our honeymoon and being newlyweds. 

We both made this decision together because we're not fans of how much money is spent on a wedding. We'd rather use that for the life we're going to live together or the honeymoon.



My fiance makes pretty good money and he is getting a promotion and pay raise. Right now, I work several jobs. I babysit for two families, clean houses and pet sit. I like the schedule that I have right now because it's pretty balanced. The time that I have in between, would give me the perfect chance to take college courses. 


Because of the nature of my jobs, I am basically my own boss and I make my own hours. The jobs that I work require me to be loyal. Loyal to them because they chose me for a reason.  They let me into their homes to interact with their kids and pets; which, is on a very personal level. I like what I do very much and I plan on continuing these types of jobs. 

So, this is actually a great time for me to get back into eating healthy, exercising, start my YouTube channel and continue to be in a better headspace. I finally figured out what I want to do in my life (at this moment). 

I figured, being productive; while, I have this free time until school starts, is the smartest thing to do. I know when school starts, I'll be busy with studying, homework and class.


I do intend to continue working at the jobs I do because it's a  smart move. 


I'd rather keep my loyalty to the individuals I currently work for. That way, when I decide to leave, I can with a good conscience and references. 


My first goal is to finish 3 associates degrees, that I put on pause, for personal reasons. I intend on finishing those in the next year.  Social Science and Behavioral Studies, Psychology, Sociology. I'm only a couple of units away with getting those AA-T's. Child Development is something new that I've decided to pursue. However, I will finish after getting the other AA's

Right now I have the perfect work schedule to do so. However, we spoke about it and he says that it's fine if I want to go back in the winter/spring. I'm finally in the mental headspace to do so. 

I don't make excellent money; but my fiance knows that and he's okay with it. He said he would help me; however, I make enough money to pay my bills. I do what I can on my part to not ask for too much. I usually only ask if I feel like I'm really in need of the money. 


He has no problems helping me out because I'm not the type of person to live a lavish life. I do my best to budget my money and live very minimal. Most of my money goes to groceries, bills &amp; gas. I try my best not to spend my money on clothes, makeup, or any other type of things like that. 


At one point, in our relationship, his job laid him off. At the time, I was the only one working. Then, that's when he found a job, that landed him in the job that he currently works. So, life has gotten better for the both of us. I started working in something I really enjoy. My fiance is working in something he enjoys and makes good money.

Lately we have been fighting a lot. We are both unhappy with how life currently is. We have not had sex in over a year (only rarely had it before then, always an excuse on her end). We rent a nice house but essentially live pay cheque to pay cheque. I hurt my credit as a teenager and my collections fall off this year so until then purchasing a house was not in the cards. I want to secure a future for my children and own a house within a few years of being licensed. I want to make moves so to speak. Our youngest is enrolled to start daycare in January and our 4yo is in school. I think a lot of our issues come from a lack of finances and I want her to do something with her life. She dropped out of high school in grade 10 and hasn't done a thing work or school wise since other than getting her ged 3 years ago. (3 month course or less). She says she is above being a psw or something like that and wanted to be a nurse. Recently she met with the community college and they basically laughed at her and told her the road would be very long. Since then she hasn't mentioned or some anything towards doing something in january. I think school is important for her social aspect as well but I'm ok if she just wants to work. I just want her to do something. She seems uninterested. I realize rejection is hard but imo she's put off doing something long enough. I was okay with her taking 4 yeArs with the first one, but our life doesn't support that luxury for our second son. 
On the non career side she is a half rate partner. At best. She doesn't care about my sexual needs, doesn't care about being a team. She is incredibly entitled. If she's bitchy she thinks I shouldn't be offended by that. If she's having a rough day (most days) she thinks I should be extra helpful and nice to her. I'm trying not to sound like too big of an ass here but in my opinion of you want to be treated nicely then treat your partner nicely. You cant have  a bad day every day and not see a doctor about it but expect special treatment. It would be 100% different if she was getting help but she's not. She says she knows she suffers with anxiety and depression but in 7 years hasn't made a step to fix it. Always shifting the blame. Whether it's shifted to me or her childhood or whoever.  Mom wise she's a good mom. Nothing special but she does what's expected. I think she would be a great mom if she would drop some habits. Which brings us to this; addictions. She smokes weed all day (in the garage not by children ). If she doesn't have weed it's a fight. I hate paying for the amount she smokes. I smoke too but I'm maybe a gram (10$) a week. She is easily 10$ or more a day. In top of that we both smoke cigarettes. I used to be the heavier smoker but recently she's been smoking double what I do.like a smoke every half hour max. Sometimes 15 mins if she's got coffee. Yes she drinks and insane amount of that too Nd only from Tim Hortons.  I can't afford these habits and I know they are hindering our progression in life. Both financially and otherwise. Last night I confronted her about the weed again and she said it's her body and slept in the couch. she's currently sitting in the car because she doesn't have weed trying to find some. I'm inside with the kids. 

Everything is always my fault because I'm an asshole.

If she doesn&amp;#39;t have weed it&amp;#39;s a fight. I hate paying for the amount she smokes. I smoke too but I&amp;#39;m maybe a gram (10$) a week. She is easily 10$ or more a day. In top of that we both smoke cigarettes. I used to be the heavier smoker but recently she&amp;#39;s been smoking double what I do.like a smoke every half hour max. Sometimes 15 mins if she&amp;#39;s got coffee. Yes she drinks and insane amount of that too Nd only from Tim Hortons.  I can&amp;#39;t afford these habits and I know they are hindering our progression in life. Both financially and otherwise. Last night I confronted her about the weed again and she said it&amp;#39;s her body and slept in the couch. she&amp;#39;s currently sitting in the car because she doesn&amp;#39;t have weed trying to find some. I&amp;#39;m inside with the kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is always my fault because I&amp;#39;m an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve had a lot more issues in the past but these are the current ones. Advice?? THanks.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"I've been with my wife for 14 years. Married for 9. Kids 5 and 7. We met when we were like 18/19. Shes the first person I've had sex with. But not the first I've done sexual things with. We dated for a few years and then I remember the moment we were in Las Vegas and I decided that I was going to save up and come back next year and ask her to marry me. 

I remember thinking she was just so easy to hang out with. Not because we had so much in common, but because there was very low expectation on her part. She kind of just went along with whatever. Which I see now had the consequence of her never really having enthusiasm for anything. She was never one who was very outgoing. Never the party animal. Not very social. And not very sexual. But she was and is beautiful. Her family was great. Non-toxic, unlike mine growing up. We didn't have many interests in common but we had college life, which put us through a lot of similar things together.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been through a lot of mental transformations in the time we've been together. Sometimes I wonder why she stuck around through 10 years of idiocy from me. I started out as a nice guy. I was pretty narcissistic. I wanted things my way. And I was manipulative. I'd give to get. But I also believed in a profound form of love and devotion where I'd practically do anything for someone. So it was kind of like: If I want something done for me, I expect it done. But similarly, if you want something done for you, I will bend over backwards to do it.

Over the years I transformed and kind of backed off the narcissistic/nice guy personality. I feel much more open. I allow people to make their choices and respect them. And know the world isn't all about me. I don't expect love. But still idealize what it could be. I believe if people just took the time to really express love and appreciation...what a world it would be.

&amp;nbsp;

We've always had fights over sex. Since we were dating until now. Always initiated by me. Always because there was lack of it, or enthusiasm. It always felt like a chore for her. Even if I'd try to spice it up by suggesting new ideas. Or focusing on her emotions and her pleasure, and creating variety and setting. I used to even say: ""Even if you want it just for you and I get nothing, let me know."" But she never took up that offer. She's openly said she doesn't like to cuddle. But I'll cuddle anyway...because I love it...and she'll allow it.

&amp;nbsp; 

The fights have declined over the years. I think I've gotten through so far because I found things in life besides sex that distract me. I've taken up many physical challenges, running marathons, lifting, etc. I push myself in many arenas. I like going out and doing things. Which reduced my need for it. I coach my kids' sports teams. I try to keep my mind busy. 

I've read countless self improvement books...to try and understand how she might feel about it. How I could change my attitude. How I could be more open about people's choices. I really only care or have the time for it once or twice a week. I look at couples who say they do it 2 times a day and while that sounds fun, I have no clue when they have the time to.

But I also think I've been lying to myself over the years...thinking we've totally got something when we haven't. Thinking she enjoys it when she doesn't. Or that she finally understands the magnitude of my need for it. Like if I just pull the wool over my eyes, I can live in a lie. Until she does this:

&amp;nbsp;

The main killer for me is her attitude about it sometimes. And although there's been plenty of times (the majority) where I'll warm her up, ask or lead her to the bedroom, and we go about it. Which often consists of me taking the lead, and little variety or effort on her end unless I suggest it. Don't get me wrong, we do several positions. I get BJs sometimes if I ask. But it's all just compliance. Not enthusiastic. 

And there's even been a few times I can count on two hands where she's actually just taken my hand and leas me upstairs. But there's also many times where I'll initiate, and the response is: *Big sigh*. ""Really?....I guess so."" And then she'll pause...as if giving me a chance to retract my request, get offended at her sigh, or just plain delay her doing it. With that attitude. Like it's a chore. Like I'm inconveniencing her.

&amp;nbsp;

And we've had plenty of conversations, trust me. Where I've said:

""You know I've grown over the years, and I respect your choices. And if you don't want to, just say: 

'look, I understand you want sex, but I really don't right now, I'm sorry' 

and I'm good. Just say it like that and I can respect that.""
 I've told her: 

""But this whole sigh and guilt trip...it really fucking hurts. It's like a punch right in the gut. You cant do that. I'm sorry if feeling hurt by that makes me weak or having conversations about it is unsexy...but I don't care. This is me. I need you to respect that."" 

And then we're good for a few weeks. And then it happens again. And the lie I've been telling myself is shattered.

&amp;nbsp;

It's been a few days of me reeling since the last one of those. And I've been alternating between 3 choices:

&amp;nbsp;

1) I just admit that this isn't what I want it to be. I divorce her. I try to get my needs met elsewhere. I think my biggest fear of this, which seems silly logically, is that she'll probably go and have sex with someone else, and pull the same routine. Which, duh, of course she will. Or that when I get divorce papers she'll just agree that its time, which confirms that I've been telling myself lies about us for years. Or that she's never really cared about us like I thought. Which also, duh, if that's the case then it was the right move.

&amp;nbsp;

2) I kill off the idealized love that I have. Say ""ok, her attitude is what it is, I live with that. I fuck purely to get off and leave it at that. I feel like killing off that ideal love is basically killing everything I really care about in life. This feeling that people can really be good to each other. And it feels like that is going to take me down a dark mental hole that I'm not sure I want to go down.

&amp;nbsp;

3) I tell myself another lie. Go back in. And believe it until it's shattered again. The time between shatterings is pleasant, even if the shatterings hurt like glass being shoved into your chest. I have another talk. Try and change her. Despite all the evidence that she's never really cared about us that way.

,Marriage,"My wife and I married while in college. She wanted to go back and live near her own family after graduation. I wanted to live near mine, but I compromised and let her have her way. I love my wife so it was an easy decision thay would make her happy.

Fast forward about 4 years. We are struggling financially. I have been hired for 3 jobs, quit 2 and about to quit my current as soon as I find the next. She works part-time and woking on a certification. We are frustrated with our financial position and need change... and a savings account.

We were together for three years before we got married. He was not like this when I met him.

My spouse has PTSD, depression, anxiety, and recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Right now our biggest problem is that he doesn't want to work.  He's 33 years old.  He should be working. He is very very very lazy. Doesn't help me around the house nor is contributing financially.
I work at a job that I hate so much. I had a conversation with him a while back that I want to leave my job so that I can go pursue a healthcare career (medical or dental). What does he decide to do? Decides to go to back to school without even asking me.  He got fired from his last job (not his fault) so hes only doing this to receive some type of income. He gets paid for going to school. He's been let go from the last 4 jobs he's held.  He doesn't like to work.

My commute is about 4-5 hours per day to my job. 
I'm only here at my house for about 9 hours and a during those 9 hours I have to cook, clean and sleep. 
He doesn't seem to understand this. The house is a mess and he waits until I get home so I can clean.  He literally doesn't do anything. I have to ask him 10 times and it still doesn't get done. 

Today I decided to stay home and work remotely because the commute is taking its toll on me. The reason I'm working at my job is because the income is great. If I take a job closer to home, im looking at a 30k to 40k decrease in my salary. Today my husband only has one class which started at 9am and he told me he has an exam. He pissed me off because he didn't study for it. It's his only job right now to go to school. 

I also made a comment to him that I don't have much money left in my savings since I've been using it on our house. 

I don't know want to do. I'm at the point where I want to move out and rent an apartment by myself.  I can't stand him any longer.  I'm only 29. I don't see myself putting up with him any longer. I'm literally ready to walk out and leave all my belongings behind and never return.

,Marriage,"Communication without anger and arguments seems almost impossible. I've done research on how to deal with my angry husband, I've tried to get us into couple's therapy, I've tried setting boundaries only to be met with ""I don't give a fuck."" I have observed that I'm always the first and only one to apologize (even when I haven't done anything to warrant this anger) I always try to direct us back to a proactive, solution oriented mindset but what I receive from him is blame, ridicule, name calling, and a convincing act of indifference veiled under defeat. I don't even care about being right or winning, what matters is putting an end to this cycle of anger, helping him get back down to earth and calming down. I've learned to not respond with more anger which I dilligently try, to walk away in heated moments which is very difficult for me (I don't want to make him feel abandoned or like I'm giving up) and I admit I'm still working on removing myself in these situations. I have learned from research and can see that his default defense mechanisms in an outburst of anger are:
- projecting an idea that he has latched on to in his mind, onto me (putting words in my mouth)
- shooting down and disagreeing with literally everything I say (even if it's constructive)
- saying he doesn't care or doesn't give a fuck
- casting the blame on me or saying I'm the problem.

these are all textbook behaviors of a person who lets their anger get the best of them. I try to remind him of this but of course it doesn't work because a person who is consumed by their own anger lacks the ability to reason and think with logic; Cortisol and adrenaline levels are high giving him a sense of power and control over whoever is in front of him which is me. His degradation and name calling aimed at me is really beginning to accumulate and do mental damage despite my willingness to show unconditional love and forgiveness every single time. I can feel myself regressing back into depression and it's like I'm tiptoeing around what I really want to say just so he won't get pissed. I will say that he has apologized after his outbursts (almost always the next day or two after) for his actions, and the names he called me. The most recent apology came with his promise to get professional help for his lack of control and understanding of his own and other's emotions; he confessed to me that he was ashamed and finally realized what he has been putting us through. I believed him...still choose to but I'm confused as to why he keeps throwing us into the same cycle of anger like he did last night. while angry, he becomes someone who doesn't seem to have any respect or love towards me and I've never seen him reach this level of anger with anyone else. I am confident in saying that I have put forth much effort towards changing my own actions in order to prevent pissing him off.

,Marriage,"[SERIOUS] To be clear, I am single. Male. Catholic. 

If I caught my future wife watching it, I’d laugh my ass off and tease her about it for a while. And tell her not to do it because it’s gross watching dirty stuff. I wouldn’t be hurt lol!! I don’t understand why some wives are hurt by this. Christian/Catholic wives especially. 

He’s not really cheating, it’s all virtual! How does it affect you in any way? Why do some wives feel worthless? Why are they overreacting?

Please do help me. I’m really trying to understand, not put people down. I genuinely don’t get it. 

Thanks!

Some people think I'm supporting watching porn. No I'm not. Really. I'm trying to look at what's really going on: a dude in front of a computer screen vs. a dude actually physically cheating. I picture this in my mind and tell myself, the first one is NOTHING compared to the second one, and the latter is messed up.

AIGHT PEOPLE! UPDATE!
I HAVE FOUND A SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO MY QUESTION, AND HAVE REALIZED A FEW THINGS ABOUT MYSELF.

1. I'm waaay to chill and laid back on the matter. I'm supposed to feel upset and hurt, hypothetically, and I don't. I'm too insensitive, and that's a bad thing.
2. A special thank you to those individuals who explained without criticizing me. Let me be clear, non-constructive criticism closes my mind and makes me think of you as an obnoxious prick.

,Marriage," I and my girlfriend are at an impasse. Both in our early thirties, been together off and on for over 3 years, and while she's keen to get married now, I have some reservations that I've expressed to her that has been draining on our relationship.

I expressed to her that even sending the pictures and texts took away from our relationship in my mind and just reinforced a lack of trust, and that its hard to see myself entering into marriage with someone that doesn't trust me.

From her perspective the issues she has with me is based on what she feels like is no commitment from me, that I always have one foot in and one foot out in the relationship, and that if she had the stability and commitment she is looking for in marriage a lot of the conflicts she creates wouldn't be as concerning.

,Marriage,"(this has been cross posted)

So my husband and I had a discussion this weekend and realized that we are in a rut. Our marriage has turned into what feels like a ""business partnership"" instead of a loving relationship. Our conversations only seem to center around things like money, chores, future plans, home improvements, ect. and we have started spending less time together because we are both associating each other with stressful topics (because that's all we discuss). We had a conversation this weekend about how we needed to work on and nurture our emotional intimacy, but we're not sure exactly where to start. 

We've discussed spending more alone time together and less time out with our friends, but I'm curious about in-home activities that helped other relationships. Being able to go out is great and all, but sometimes budget's don't allow for that. Sitting in front of the television watching movies/shows and not speaking to each other doesn't exactly nurture the relationship.   

 I'm sure this is a normal thing to deal with, so for those who have struggled with this, how did you and your partner tackle this and address the issue? 





And as an add on: my husband is a blue collar worker. He's expressed that he doesn't really ""know"" himself or what he likes to do, because by the time he gets home every day he's exhausted from his job and falls asleep on the couch as soon as he eats. We both agree this is also part of the reason we are having trouble, because he doesn't really have anything to converse about besides his work (and I don't understand what he's talking about 100% of the time). He's expressed that he wants to find some hobbies, but we don't know where to start. He's too tired to do anything too physically demanding, so if anyone know who knows the burden of hard labor and has any cool hobby ideas that we can explore, please, I'd love to hear them. We have decided to go do things that you can get on Groupon like pasta making classes, paint nights, ect. but we'd both really like him to find a hobby to enjoy so he has something in his life other than eat, work, sleep, drink.

,Marriage,"My wife and I have been together for almost 4 years. We have 2 toddlers and work A LOT. If we're lucky, we may have 2 full days off together.

Every morning is the same routine. We wake up, feed the kids, clean up, drop them off at my mother's and head to work. We get off late night, pick the kids up, put them to bed, shower, cook, clean, wash dishes, talk a little bit, start on a movie but rarely finish because we're both tired, may have sex if we have any energy left, go to bed then do it all over again.

On our days off, we run errands, go grocery shopping, take the kids to the park,  catch up on chores, might go out to eat if we're lazy to cook, might slip in an afternoon delight, play with the kids, catch up on our shows, then do it all over again.

Here's the twist though... whenever one of us has free time to hang out with our friends, one gets upset with the other. She hates that I like to drink with my buddies and I hate that she smokes with hers. This is what we fight about on the regular.

I really hate it when she signs me up to plans with her friends without consulting me because she never wants to do anything with my friends. She says that I never plan anything that's why... well of course not! I'm a guy. When I'm free, I just hit my boys up to see if their free, then we get together. I would invite her to come but she always tries to guilt trip me.

Well okay...

Maybe we can do something else together on our free time huh? So we signed up for a YMCA membership, which we've only visited ONCE.

Not to mention I would love to take that time to visit home and relieve some feelings of isolation.  We&amp;#39;ve definitely talked over these issues and are thinking about counseling.  But how much of this is normal?  I am getting really down on myself for basically changing so much and not really for the better.  And I am resentful of him for not changing enough and acting like everything should be practically as easy as it was!  Somebody shed some perspective please.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"My husband and I have been together for 6 years. Everything has been great (we've never had a major fight or argument, always happy go lucky) until recently.

We were driving home from the movies and he asked me to look up directions because of traffic. My phone was acting up so he gave me his. Welp, that's where I saw the porn tabs. Then awkwardly in the car he talked about how he buys amateur videos from redditors and feet pictures. I asked him if I wasn't enough because that was my first thought. No, actually my first thought was that I am so fucking naive. I honestly didn't think he was looking at porn at all and that he only had eyes for me. Man, I'm stupid.

Then instead of telling him to stop I decided to let it go. 

Then he went away on a business trip six months later and I saw more porn tabs when he was away. I felt so disgusted. I had been sending him pics and videos while he was gone, but I guess it wasn't enough. So he came back and showered in the morning. His phone went off so I checked it and he had sent a nude Snapchat to one of the Reddit NSFW gonewild whatever the fuck. Not showing his face. Just his chest, feet, and boxers and penis. I felt even more sick until I told him and he said he was sorry and that this lady just likes to know what her customers look like. He said she's just a normal woman like me.

Yeah fucking right. I would never show a male model my body. He says he wouldn't be hurt or offended if I looked at other guys or a man with a larger penis.

Also, he's really funny about his phone. He never leaves it to show the screen at any point. It's always gotta be in his pocket or face down which i find highly suspicious. You think he would share that he buys feet pics before getting married because that's a fucking deal breaker for me.

I want to make him stop completely. Maybe do a /r/nofap, but that seems controlling. I don't want to control him, but I can't live like this. I'm never going to feel 100% loved or good about myself knowing this.

&lt;p&gt;We were driving home from the movies and he asked me to look up directions because of traffic. My phone was acting up so he gave me his. Welp, that&amp;#39;s where I saw the porn tabs. Then awkwardly in the car he talked about how he buys amateur videos from redditors and feet pictures. I asked him if I wasn&amp;#39;t enough because that was my first thought. No, actually my first thought was that I am so fucking naive. I honestly didn&amp;#39;t think he was looking at porn at all and that he only had eyes for me. Man, I&amp;#39;m stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then instead of telling him to stop I decided to let it go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he went away on a business trip six months later and I saw more porn tabs when he was away. I felt so disgusted. I had been sending him pics and videos while he was gone, but I guess it wasn&amp;#39;t enough. So he came back and showered in the morning. His phone went off so I checked it and he had sent a nude Snapchat to one of the Reddit NSFW gonewild whatever the fuck. Not showing his face. Just his chest, feet, and boxers and penis. I felt even more sick until I told him and he said he was sorry and that this lady just likes to know what her customers look like. He said she&amp;#39;s just a normal woman like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah fucking right. I would never show a male model my body. He says he wouldn&amp;#39;t be hurt or offended if I looked at other guys or a man with a larger penis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, he&amp;#39;s really funny about his phone. He never leaves it to show the screen at any point. It&amp;#39;s always gotta be in his pocket or face down which i find highly suspicious. You think he would share that he buys feet pics before getting married because that&amp;#39;s a fucking deal breaker for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make him stop completely. Maybe do a &lt;a href=""/r/nofap""&gt;/r/nofap&lt;/a&gt;, but that seems controlling. I don&amp;#39;t want to control him, but I can&amp;#39;t live like this. I&amp;#39;m never going to feel 100% loved or good about myself knowing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think?&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Throwaway because I feel bad for even having to make a post like this. I just need to get this off my chest. 

We’ve been married for 5, and over the span of the last few years he’s gained about 20 kg (44 lbs) which puts him at 100kg (220 lbs). I think he gained the most weight when I was pregnant. I ate a lot at night and he joined me.. unfortunately I lost all the weight and Im in good shape while he gained even more. 

Honestly I didnt even notice he was gaining THAT much weight until I started to notice how much bigger he looked in photos. I am still attracted to him for the most part..but I do miss the way he looked when he was in shape. Its not just the way he looks. Its how much more lethargic he’s gotten in everyday life (and in bed).   

The main problem is that he eats his feelings. He asked me to help him lose weight a couple months ago by cooking clean meals every dinner which I have done. He has a pretty high stress job so when weekends come, he eats late night fried food and unhealthy snacks between meals! He will listen to me if I remind him to make healthier choices sometimes but gets annoyed if I keep doing it. 

Exercise wise, he’s been walking on the treadmill for 40 min every night which is good but i dont think thats enough to burn off the amount of calories he intakes.  

My mother was very harsh on me when I gained weight in college, and it caused me to have a bad relationship with food (I still struggle with it sometimes). She would ask me why I was at the dinner table. “You shouldnt be eating” she would say. “You dont look good anymore.” It was all very hurtful and I would never want my husband to feel the way I did.

,Marriage,"I was 16 when we met. We started dating 10 days later, and we have been together every day since. Now I'm 32. That means we've been together for half of my life, and the majority of my waking life. I'll admit I've been proud of that. When we meet other couples our age, I'll think to myself, *Okay, maybe--MAYBE--they love each other as much as we do, but we've got them on hours*. Like a Fitbit counts steps. Cool, yes, you have a Fitbit, too. But we've took enough steps to circle the globe a few times. We're still young, but our love has a patina. It's aged a bit in the cellar. Our emotional odometer has counted so many miles, it capped out at 999,999 awhile ago--and now our engine runs on magic. If the mechanic asks how it's still running, we just laugh at him. It runs *because it fucking wants to*. More than anything has ever wanted to.

But today or tomorrow--or a week at most--all of that changes. We're going to have a baby. I'm not sad that everything will change. I'm ready for it, and I know you are, too. I do not fear things will be worse. But I also do not believe things will be better. Just different. Very different. Our whole love equation will be more dynamic. Love may not be a finite resource, but time is. And it takes time to show love. We're going from a party of two to a party of three. The math of devotion is about to get more complicated.

People older than us probably laughed at my first paragraph. *Whipper snapper, I've been married 50 years!* But how many of those people waited 16 years to have a kid? I never judge the way others' love evolves; everyone's love story is fantastically different. But we've been throwing this two-person party for such a long time, I think the sudden shift of a child will feel more cosmic. It's shifting a greater inertia for us than it does for others. Again, I'm ready for that. But I want to take a moment to recognize how BIG it will feel for us, given our long, private life. And I want to take a moment to thank you.

I do not fear things will be worse. But I also do not believe things will be better. Just different. Very different. Our whole love equation will be more dynamic. Love may not be a finite resource, but time is. And it takes time to show love. We're going from a party of two to a party of three. The math of devotion is about to get more complicated.

People older than us probably laughed at my first paragraph. *Whipper snapper, I've been married 50 years!* But how many of those people waited 16 years to have a kid? I never judge the way others' love evolves; everyone's love story is fantastically different.

Again, I'm ready for that. But I want to take a moment to recognize how BIG it will feel for us, given our long, private life. And I want to take a moment to thank you.

I was a dumb kid when we met, even as teenage boys go. The only thing I did right at that age was realize you are the real deal. And I am just so grateful for the time we've had together. Each and every hour. It has been a joy to love you more than anything else. I have so much doubt in my life--about almost everything I do--but I have never doubted that loving you was the best thing for me to do with my time. As I prepare to let another human cut into that finite resource of time, I want to say I am SO FUCKING EXCITED to have a baby with you. But I think it's also important for me to say (maybe for other people out there considering having a baby?) that I would have happily lived a long life of loving you, and only you, too. It has been wonderful. Every second. And I could have done it forever. Both of these things can be true: wanting a baby, and wanting only you.

,Marriage,"I’m frustrated and tired, but I need advice from others with more experience. TLDR at the bottom:

My husband is a year older than me, but here’s a brief history of what led us to me wondering if this is even something I can repair with him:

A year and a half ago we moved states for his job- no family at ALL in the same state as us. We had a 6 month old at the time but I was excited about moving. Within a month of moving I found a job there and daycare close to where we lived. 

Well, 6 months later my husband was dissatisfied with his job and quit for something different. He did the same thing again 5-6 months later, and after doing that job for 3-4 months he decided he didn’t enjoy it because it was too hard. He can still continue doing that job if he wants, but he has no desire to so I consider him unemployed. He hasn’t earned an income since June.

I encouraged him with each job, even after he told his family I made him quit one job and he regretted it. I encouraged him taking this last job even though it wasn’t a guarantee that he would make money, but I wanted to be supportive of him. 

Now I’m stressed because we’re barely paying all our bills, and our credit card bills are piling up. We have more bills than what my income can cover. I’ve proposed pulling our daughter from daycare and him being a stay at home dad, but his excuse is he wants to work and wouldn’t be able to start right away or attend interviews as a SAHD. Daycare would save us about $950 a month, which would be more than enough to bring our bills down to less than what I make.

My struggle is his lack of motivation. He’s had his thyroid and testosterone tested and everything is normal. He’s seen a therapist (2 months after I told him he should) and said everything is fine. He wants to switch career fields entirely to do something he’s never done before, and is convinced he’ll love it. However, to do that he needs to finish a Bachelor’s degree. In the meantime, he won’t suck it up and get any job. 

We literally just need a job that would pay him about $1,000 a month. He could do that part time and still have time for school. He’s unmotivated and I don’t know how to help. He watches YouTube all day and barely cleans the house or takes care of the yard. I’m frustrated because of money and him. I don’t know how to deal with it and can’t afford to keep seeing my therapist because that costs more money than we can afford right now, so I don’t know how to deal with this. 

I’ve told my husband my concerns and he blames himself and puts himself down, even when I’m not trying to make him feel bad, but these are the facts. Even after talking to him about it nothing has changed. He went to a job fair when I told him about one and 5 minutes later he called me and was bitching about the event. He’s so critical of everything and cynical about jobs, not to mention quick to judge other people. 

He even wanted to sell our house and get a cheaper apartment (which would only save us $500 a month). Has anyone else dealt with this? I don’t know what to do and want to consider splitting up. At this rate, I could get a roommate and continue me and my daughter’s current lifestyles without him in our life.

I’ve had a lot of ups and downs in my marriage, just like everyone else. But I ask myself every time I’m in a rut or a dire financial situation etc “is this all that you can do? Are you being your BEST self, and did you do literally everything you could and exhausted ALL efforts?” 

I moved across country again, got a job full time but they’re 12 hour shifts, so I’ve got 1/2 of the year that I can fill with 2 more jobs. In the navy I worked 100+ hour work weeks so I know I can still do it. Desensitized to holidays/birthdays since I’m either gone or nobody really cares about my bday so I just push forward. 4 kids later living with the in laws until I can get a house, should take 1-3 months, but as I sit here I am thinking is this the best I can do? Did I give every ounce of my body and every waking moment to providing for my family?

And I know I can do more. I think of that breaking bad quote “what does a man do? A man provides” and it is such a powerful message, I can’t help but think of it all the time. Especially when he says “and he does it..even if he is not appreciated..or respected..or even loved. He simply bears up and he does it. Because he is a man”. It hurts. I’m tired, I’m missing out on things, I’m lonely, and definitely in the category of “taken for granted” with none of my needs met but that’s our job. I do it to make sure my wife and kids want for nothing. They have everything they need and could ever want. My kids will know that I worked hard, I provided them with everything to be successful, and that when you have kids it’s no longer about you it’s about them.

As most marriages...we tend to have arguments about household chores and responsibilities. 

Recently, I shared a post from the 'She Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes by the Sink' article stating:

*""I remember my wife often saying how exhausting it was for her to have to tell me what to do all the time.  It's why the sexiest thing a man can say to his partner is ""I got this,"" and then take care of whatever needs taken care of.*

*I always responded: ""If you just tell me what you want me to do, I'll gladly do it.""*

*But she didn't want to be my mother.  She wanted to be my partner, and she wanted me to apply all of my intelligence and learning capabilities to the logistics of managing our lives and household.*

*She wanted me to figure out all of the things that need done, and devise my own method of task management.""* 

The next day after posting it, my husband called me into the other room and showed it to me, saying ""that's not how it works.  And every therapist will tell you that.""

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But she didn&amp;#39;t want to be my mother.  She wanted to be my partner, and she wanted me to apply all of my intelligence and learning capabilities to the logistics of managing our lives and household.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She wanted me to figure out all of the things that need done, and devise my own method of task management.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day after posting it, my husband called me into the other room and showed it to me, saying &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s not how it works.  And every therapist will tell you that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just looked at him...said &amp;quot;okay.&amp;quot;  ...and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m curious how other husbands on here would respond to that post?&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"I’ll try to keep this short. My wife and I are recently married we are approaching our one year anniversary soon. I still deeply love my wife. Our careers are in different fields so we don’t get a whole lot of time together usually one weekend day a week and I usually see her every night after 6pm. We have one child together and my wife is currently pregnant. Overall I’m happy with our marriage. I love my wife deeply, I do wish she would be more physical with me. She doesn’t really cuddle with me or hug me or hold my hand very often we also don’t have sex very often maybe once every 2-3 weeks  but other than the additional show of affection I don’t have any complains. If you spoke to her she has a whole list of complaints. She says that I don’t help out enough with our daughter, I don’t cook dinner often enough when I get home before her, I don’t clean up around the house enough either, she doesn’t want me hang out with my friends so she gets upset if I decide to. 

We argue a lot. Of course coming from my point of view she’s always making a big deal out of nothing she gets upset really easily and i can tell and it has an effect on us. She’s irritated about something and it snow balls into a full blown argument. 

Here is the problem I have, we argue to the point I blow up. I literally lose it. Bang my hands on table start screaming at her and using profanity even sometimes called her names like bitch or crazy when I get like that.

It’s just once I get backed into a corner and she’s continuously beating me over the head about the issue I just lose it on her. I’m just at a total loss. I love her to death but I feel like it’s not a good sign that she drives me so nuts like that. I know it’s verbally abusive and I hate that and I know it makes my wife feel horrible and she starts crying hysterically and now started apologizing to me for making me crazy. I’m just not sure if this is a sign that we shouldn’t be together or what.

,Marriage,"My grandma and grandpa were always my gold standard when it came to the ideal marriage.

When I was younger my grandma always used to tell us the story of how the two of them met and fell in love. Of course they wouldn‘t divulge any info about their times as refugees or their experiences with war. But their love was always the focal point of the story anyway.
My grandpa and grandma both grew up in the same small town at the same time, without ever meeting. When war came and forced them to flee, my grandma and her family went first. They traveled for ages until they managed to reach some distant relatives over 900 km away. My grandpa, his younger brother and their parents stayed a while longer.

As it was, he and his family happened to go to the exact same town my grandma‘s family had fled to.

My grandma was annoyed that she had to be there at all. She said her friend teased her about her grumpy face for the whole night.

,Marriage,"I thought…

I thought that a happy marriage was almost certainly a sure thing if I married a nice person with…

* The same socioeconomic background
* The same ethnic background
* The same level of education

I thought that I needed to find my future wife in our social circle in college, or it was too late. I thought I’d found the right person because all of our mutual friends told us we were nice, caring, pleasant people that were perfect for each other.

I thought that Sunday school and confirmation in the same kind of church meant similar views on faith and spirituality

I thought that the same background of sexual experience (or relative lack thereof) meant sexual compatibility

I thought that I was being a kind person, a caring person, an unselfish person, by pushing aside some serious doubts in my mind and going ahead with a flashy wedding that my fiancé, our parents, my grandparents (who were in declining health and didn’t have many years left), and our social circle all seemed to be expecting and looking forward to.  *(in retrospect, not speaking up, not asserting myself, not expressing my doubts was the cruelest, most assholish thing I have ever done in my entire life).* I thought I was being noble and a man of high character, instead I was being a cowardly, cruel piece of shit.

I thought that daydreaming about getting run over by a car as I was crossing the street the week before my wedding was simply a quirky sign of momentary cold feet.

Even though I went through much of our engagement with nausea in my stomach, I thought our wedding day would magically flip a switch. That signing our marriage license and putting on our wedding rings would infuse us with magic relationship powers to knock down the red and yellow flags that were waving.

I thought that because both my parents and my in-laws had celebrated 25-year anniversaries, my wife and I had the perfect model and genetics for a lifelong happy marriage. Toasting their marriages was the highlight of my wedding reception speech. I told our crowd of 300 guests my wife and I could aspire to nothing greater than their seemingly perfect marriage examples.

I thought that my parents were doing me a huge loving favor by hiding conflict and the messiness of life from me, to give me an idyllic and worry-free childhood. For my first 20 years, I lived a content Leave It To Beaver type childhood. (The 20 years after that descended into misery.)

I thought that because my wife and I “saved ourselves for marriage”, our honeymoon would flip another switch, turning sex from something unfamiliar and even shameful, into an extremely fulfilling part of our lives that would bring us closeness. I thought that because we had refrained from fucking around, either each other or other people, that God, or Jesus, or kharma, or somebody owed us an amazing married sex life as a reward for premarital restraint.

I thought that being booksmart and conventionally “accomplished”, high school valedictorian with some varsity sports letters, graduating college with a near 4.0, and then advancing in a good career meant I was too good to fail at other things in my life. Academically and in business I was making great decisions; therefore I blinded myself that I might be making disastrous decisions and efforts in other even more important parts of my life.

Once I became deeply depressed after getting married, I thought that a magic pill would solve all these problems. I thought that after a year or two of Zoloft helped nothing, all I needed was a different magic pill. After a year or two of the next magic pill (Wellbutrin) did nothing…my psychiatrist and I thought that perhaps different combinations of different magic pills might help me to someday win the emotional happiness lottery….

As I continued to have near-zero sex drive and attraction, my psychiatrist and I thought that Viagra would fix everything in that department, including maybe counteracting the antidepressants. So as a 27-year old man, I filled my first Viagra prescription.  Well, for some odd reason Viagra didn't seem to do a damn thing to rev up any sexual interest, drive or performance in this situation.  Later there was a period of a couple years where I stopped taking any antidepressant drug, still no change. Antidepressants or no antidepressants, Viagra or no Viagra, none of it seemed to make a difference as far as sex attraction and interest.

I thought that being a good husband, a kind husband, meant holding your tongue, always being agreeable, avoiding conflict. I thought being respectful and pleasant and calm meant the same thing as being loving and caring.

I thought that teaching college classes, giving conference presentations to a hundred people, writing winning proposals for business and scientific projects meant that I was somehow a good communicator (one on one, I now realize I’m actually a terrible communicator).

I thought that having kids would fix all of the above.

I thought it would be impossible for two nice and accomplished people to bring each other unhappiness and misery.

I was so, so incredibly wrong. Disastrously wrong. About all of the above.

I thought I did the things that would bring me success and happiness. Instead, as of a year ago, I had utterly failed at life.

Yes, I’ve been seeing a series of psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists for 15+ years. Last couple years I’ve been regularly seeing the best therapist I’ve ever had. I’ve been able to open up more to her than to anyone else in my life (including my wife and others in my family). For the first time I shared some of the thoughts that I’ve written above with another human being. I started a bit of a path to recovery, feeling better sometimes, but still many long periods of depression, including suicidal thoughts. Medication didn’t seem to be doing anything. Talk therapy perhaps helped a little bit.

Then, almost a year ago to the day, my dad, in a drunken stupor, shot himself in the basement of my childhood home.

I thought…. this would destroy me, the final blow in a long series of unhappy events and influences in my adulthood. My therapist immediately went into crisis mode, having me check in every couple days, making sure this wasn’t going to trigger my own suicide or some other extreme action.

Instead, the strangest thing happened. I miss my dad tremendously, and am very sad about his passing. But since that day, my own suicidal thoughts, and much of my depression, have mostly vanished. Up until a week ago, I had been very happy for several months, perhaps the happiest I have ever been in my adult life. The last week, I’ve been quite down again, mainly because I’ve realized my marriage still sucks.

My mom told me recently that in the year since my dad took his own life, she’s been questioning a lot of her life, how her life was with my dad, how they raised me and my siblings and what our childhood environment was like, and how this has affected us into adulthood. I’d known somewhat about my dad’s alcoholism and depression but have recently learned it was much more severe and extended for much longer periods of time than I thought. Out of love, my parents thought they were shielding us kids from it…they did a really good job of shielding us from it and perhaps that was for the best, but…perhaps not.

I’ve also recently learned that my in-laws seemingly perfect marriage, now approaching 50 years, is on very shaky ground and there’s a 50/50 chance they will be divorcing or separating in the near future. When I try to observe them with an outsider’s eyes, they haven’t seemed happy together in many years.

One of the reasons I’ve been hesitant to end our marriage is “what would our families think? The horror, the shame, blah, blah, blah…” Well, in the last year, I find myself caring a lot less about what any of our parents think.

You only live once and our time on this earth is limited, as my dad's death has shown me. A lot of therapy and self-reflection has made me realize, my marriage is probably not going to survive. It probably shouldn’t survive. We never should (ed: ~~probably shouldn’t~~) have gotten married.  But I’m okay with all that. I’ve made some huge mistakes, we’ve both been cruel to each other but care for each other. Basically, right now I’m staying for our kids, who we both love dearly.  My kids have by far been the best part of my life in the last 15 years. As near countless posts have touched on, staying for the kids is not necessarily the right solution and that’s the next big issue I’ve got to work through….

I realized I blended two major themes in this point, all my misconceptions and mistakes about marriage, and then my dad’s suicide and both of our mental health challenges. If you’ve made it to the end, thanks for reading. Not sure what the main message I’m trying to send is, but if I can help anyone avoid the same mistakes I’ve made, maybe this post is worth something.

Out of love, my parents thought they were shielding us kids from it…they did a really good job of shielding us from it and perhaps that was for the best, but…perhaps not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also recently learned that my in-laws seemingly perfect marriage, now approaching 50 years, is on very shaky ground and there’s a 50/50 chance they will be divorcing or separating in the near future. When I try to observe them with an outsider’s eyes, they haven’t seemed happy together in many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I’ve been hesitant to end our marriage is “what would our families think? The horror, the shame, blah, blah, blah…” Well, in the last year, I find myself caring a lot less about what any of our parents think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You only live once and our time on this earth is limited, as my dad&amp;#39;s death has shown me. A lot of therapy and self-reflection has made me realize, my marriage is probably not going to survive. It probably shouldn’t survive. We never should (ed: &lt;del&gt;probably shouldn’t&lt;/del&gt;) have gotten married.  But I’m okay with all that. I’ve made some huge mistakes, we’ve both been cruel to each other but care for each other. Basically, right now I’m staying for our kids, who we both love dearly.  My kids have by far been the best part of my life in the last 15 years. As near countless posts have touched on, staying for the kids is not necessarily the right solution and that’s the next big issue I’ve got to work through….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized I blended two major themes in this point, all my misconceptions and mistakes about marriage, and then my dad’s suicide and both of our mental health challenges. If you’ve made it to the end, thanks for reading. Not sure what the main message I’m trying to send is, but if I can help anyone avoid the same mistakes I’ve made, maybe this post is worth something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Much of what I thought was important in picking a spouse and starting a marriage was all wrong, and it can cause decades of unhappiness for both you and your spouse.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"My husband is just wonderful. Obviously we each have our flaws, but he tries to hard all the time. We've been married 2.5 years and have been together for 5 years.

Right now, he's not working (laid off with severence, plus we're planning on moving to another state within the next few weeks), I'm working 55 or so hours a week. Today, he insisted on picking me up from work and then spontaniously took me to get dinner (I'm an executive chef and work long hours). When we got home, the laundry was done, folded and hung up; he did this because I mentioned this morning that I needed to do laundry when I got home because I didn't have enough work clothes to get through the weekend, but he took the time out of his day to do laundry to make sure I was taken care of.

He surprises me with flowers, little sweet treats, hand written cards, etc. all on a regular basis. He means the world to me and I mean the world to him. 

Don't get me wrong, we're not perfect. We bicker, but are able to communicate well enough to where we don't really fight (I can count one one hand the times we've had fights throughout our relationship). But we've always been able to agree on a conclusion or compromise and move on. 

When we took our vows during our wedding, we took them seriously. We are there for each other in sickness and in health (which has happened several times already). He is my best friend, my forever person. 

He's very open about his love for me and says/shows it all the time. I grew up in a family where we never really shared our feelings for one another. It took moving 2000 miles away to finally tell my mom I love her whenever I talk to her.

,Marriage,"My husband told me on August 25th that he wants to call it quits on our marriage. It's a long story, so I'll cut it short. We were a very happy couple but after months of hurtful arguments and my mental health crumbling (and me not seeking treatment) he got to his breaking point.

It took me long enough but I've grown utterly horrified by my actions (have since sincerely apologized) and got to the root of the issue. I've minimized interactions with anyone who threatens my mental stability (my mother), started therapy, got back on my medication, started waking up at a healthy time, eat cleaner, exercise/yoga, read self-help books, working on myself spiritually, get back into my creative space and have been all around much more positive and happy.

He's acknowledged my changes but tells me that he's afraid to get his hopes up because what if it's only a phase. Which I absolutely understand. 

We are back on friendlier terms. He knows I respect his decision to want to end our relationship even though I REALLY want to save and repair our marriage.

We speak several times throughout the week. I still stay in our home, he moved in with his brother. He comes by to pick up or drop off things. We make excuses to call one another and we talk and catch up and laugh together like old times. We sometimes spend hours just texting each other memes and silly videos and laughing. 

Something tells me that there is still hope and I want to hang on to our marriage (it hasn't even been a month and we've made so much progress to enjoy our friendship again already). 

Is it wrong or disrespectful to his wishes if I continue to wear my wedding ring? As far as I'm concerned, he hasn't even filed for divorce yet and doesn't seem to be in a rush to make that move.

,Marriage," I need some help and some advice. I hope this is an appropriate place to discuss my worries and maybe get some insight from others because I am truly at a loss.

Husband and I are early 30s, no kids and with no plan for them at this point. While our marriage is relatively recent, we’ve been together since we are 18 – straight through with no breaks or break-ups. Neither of us has ever lived alone; we moved right from college in with each other. We are both in professional, high-stress careers. We both travel for work once every few months for 3-4 days at a time. 

On the personal side, we both have mental health issues. Mine are well controlled with medication and individual therapy. His issue is also pretty well controlled by medication, although there have been some dosage problems (relevant later) and periods where he has chosen not to take his medication. I think he would agree with my saying that his issue does affect his daily life and his actions/preferences – sometimes in a positive way and sometimes in a negative way.

A few years ago, I was diagnosed with a chronic illness. Before my diagnosis, while I was being tested for everything under the sun, we were both worried it could be cancer or another potentially life-threatening diagnosis. There were a lot of tears. Thankfully, it turned out to be something that could be managed, although there is no cure and I will have to be monitored for the rest of my life. This was the impetus for our engagement – I think we were both acutely aware of our mortality and I, at the time, was scared I was going to lose out on the opportunity to be a mother.

Since my diagnosis (and maybe starting a bit before), I have changed a LOT. My husband was, and is, one of the most charismatic and talkative people you will ever meet. People love him and he loves being the center of a conversation. I would say that he often expects to be the most liked, most talked to, person in the room (I’m not sure he would agree with that). This worked well for us for a long time because I was always shyer and quieter. I am an introvert – I like people and am social, but I really need alone time to recharge. He’s never been good at giving me space to recharge, but I felt like I could compromise on that. I was always happy to just be there and be supportive of him. Looking back, I would describe it as me being happy being Ron to his Harry Potter. I felt lucky just to be included in his shine. He really is a catch – he is attractive, fit, driven, and fun to be around. In the last two or so years, I have not been happy with that status quo. I want to be the main character in my own story. I want to have those center of attention moments. I want to be independent, have my own hobbies rather than tagging along with his, and to spend time with myself and my friends without being worried about him getting mad at me for not being home when he wants me to be or for not having dinner made.

This newfound need for independence and alone time would be navigable on its own, I think, but it has just made our other problems a lot worse and all of them together is just too much for me to handle. I feel like his mother and his maid a lot. He has very particular ideas about how a household should be run but leaves all the everyday issues to me. I do 90% of the chores, cooking, and other household management tasks. It is exhausting. It has been this way for probably the last 6 or so years, with the occasional burst of motivation from him after enough nagging. I even tried to implement a chore chart to make it a competition and get him more interested (or at least get him to see how much I was doing). It failed after a few weeks and made me feel even more like his mother. It’s a huge turn off. My therapist had me read a book about codependency and has encouraged me to stop cleaning up after him and doing tasks for him. I am trying but then I just have a dirty house that makes me want to cry when I come home from a 10 hour work day. I’ve considered hiring a maid but that just pisses me off – he has time to play video games or watch TV for 3 hours a night but I have to hire someone to collect his dirty dishes and underwear from around the house? My therapist is now asking me whether I would consider moving out temporarily so that I could at least have some peace when it comes to my space because after a year of me working to make this better during individual therapy, nothing has changed.

The lack of initiative at home and my constant annoyance over having to have conversations about this has killed my sex drive. My husband is very attractive but whenever I think about having sex with him, I just feel a pit in my stomach. This got worse when he changed mental health medications, flipped out, violated my privacy in several ways, lied about violating my privacy, and then accused me of doing some really awful things (that I emphatically did not do and there was no evidence to support that I did). I didn’t make the situation better by lying to him to smooth things out and avoid the conflict.

I feel like I can’t count on him to carry his weight in our relationship and to be my support. This pisses me off even more because I feel like for 10 years, I was the most supportive partner I could imagine and now he can’t return the favor when I need it from him. I have unilaterally paused our plans to buy a house and have children. I know that I can’t take on any more work than I already have and I will not make it worse for myself (or for potential children). I have aired all of this out to him and the only part that really got feedback was my lack of sexual desire and my need for physical space from him. He does not think it’s a fair ask but is trying to respect my wishes as a temporary compromise. I’ve floated the idea of counseling, but he was not interested. 

Reddit – where do I go next? I will not live my life as my husband’s mother and I have burnt myself out giving every piece of myself to him. I feel like I have no identity on my own and I am ready to say fuck it and be selfish and do whatever the hell I feel necessary to get myself back into a place where I feel happy.

This got worse when he changed mental health medications, flipped out, violated my privacy in several ways, lied about violating my privacy, and then accused me of doing some really awful things (that I emphatically did not do and there was no evidence to support that I did). I didn’t make the situation better by lying to him to smooth things out and avoid the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I can’t count on him to carry his weight in our relationship and to be my support. This pisses me off even more because I feel like for 10 years, I was the most supportive partner I could imagine and now he can’t return the favor when I need it from him. I have unilaterally paused our plans to buy a house and have children. I know that I can’t take on any more work than I already have and I will not make it worse for myself (or for potential children). I have aired all of this out to him and the only part that really got feedback was my lack of sexual desire and my need for physical space from him. He does not think it’s a fair ask but is trying to respect my wishes as a temporary compromise. I’ve floated the idea of counseling, but he was not interested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit – where do I go next? I will not live my life as my husband’s mother and I have burnt myself out giving every piece of myself to him. I feel like I have no identity on my own and I am ready to say fuck it and be selfish and do whatever the hell I feel necessary to get myself back into a place where I feel happy. My husband says he is okay with me being independent in theory, but in practice, it’s not happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every night I have to cook when I get home. My wife knows how to cool however she has not motivation too. She would rather just throw some bread with peanut butter on it at the kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house never gets clean and laundry always stacks up. She talks about getting a job but barely looks. I just don’t know what to do. Sits around all day and plays on her phone or watches tv. I hate the way she’s raising kids. Tried marriage therapy didn’t work. Always good for a day or two then back to it. Any advise? I love her but I hate what we’ve become.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"desination weddings and hoopla on TLC, what about destination divorce? I think I just witnessed my parents pull it off.

Im getting back from a weekend in lake tahoe when I get a strange text from my mom saying something about dad’s got life changing news.

Naturally I start to panick and I was praying it wasn’t cancer. She advised i talk to him in person about the matter, so when he got home I pressed him on what the situation was. His response was that he would be moving &amp; living back in Mexico, his home country.

Side note, he immigrated legally and just recently last year became a united states citizen.

After spendinf 30 years in the USA, he basically was like “nah i think Mexico is more chill and I’m more happier there”. obviously im generalized but you get the gist.

Resuming my story: I was mindfucked. My parents never argued in the past 15 or so years, never cheated, never really had beef, nothing. My dad said he’d be leaving in a week and that it was very hard for him to do but he felt like he had to.  I was even more mindfucked at this point. I left and didnt speak to him for a few days. Few days later I Suddenly I began to process this new information and realized the reality of it all.  

If youre curious my Mom was a lil upset from the news but she’s a strong and independent type so she kept it real.

Today, i took my dad to the airport and gave him the right send off. I can hardly believe In a matter of a week, i saw my parents (seemingly) happy together....to filing divorce papers and separating. 

Now, im not mindfucked anymore. This has to be in the top 3 cleanest divorces in world history. I just bared mf witness to that shit and it was unlike the typically divorce story we always hear about.

Heres the part where i add that im 24M. I realize i was fortunate to have my dad present during childhood. I realized the difference it made in my life. I realized ive transitioned into adulthood and make my own decisions on my own time at my own expense. I.e im no longer dependent on any delicate family structure. 

This broadened my understanding of life, in such a crazy way. Parents have a responsibility to raise their offspring for ~18-21 years (my whole hearted opinion). If theyve succeeded in that after said amount of years, theyve fulfilled their dooty (get it? Cause they cleaned up your shitty diapers and jouvenile nonsense)

Fuck, parents are people too children! But we see them as a joint person growing up. Im happy for both my parents in the sense that theyre getting another turn at living out their best lives in the ways they mightve ruled out years ago.

In short, this was the perfect divorce scenerio. the anyone would want to bare through.

,Marriage,"EDIT/UPDATE: H!! Thanks so much to everyone who commented -- I figured since people are still commenting I'd update really fast! I sat down with him over the weekend, showed him this entire reddit post and thread, and told him we had a marriage counseling appointment for Monday. There was a massive blow out fight, he was pissed about the entire situation, and in denial there was an issue, but we went the to the session, and it turned into a very dramatic and heavy session almost right off the bat, but the therapist was quick to ask him about his gaming, and me about how I approach the issues, ect. They were very matter of fact, and blunt about a lot of things initially. We have another appointment for next week, but he's not touching the gaming systems this week so we can see what behavior/habit changes there are when he's not so ""occupied"". He's pretty pissy about it as of right now, but he didn't game last night so we shall see. Thanks to everyone who gave advice, here's to hoping something works!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let me be clear. I love my husband. I love him so very much. We have been together for almost 12 years, and friends for 14. He is my best friend, and I'm so proud to be his wife, relationship wise, asides from what I'm about to say below, we are great. Trust, love, friendship, all there. He works hard at work and is a good provider, but he is SO lazy at home..

Recently we hit a wall, and I don't know how to get around it. Up until our child was born I really didn't mind doing a little extra housework here and there, because he really doesn't do, and never has done, anything in regards to house upkeep, but after our child was born, I continued to work, yet found myself still doing all the housework, AND entirely all of the childcare minus maybe 2 hours a day he was responsible for (I'd work nights, so he'd watch her a couple hours until bedtime, then I'd take care of her mid-night when I got back, until she was older and no longer needed that). This continued for a couple years, and I built up a lot of resentment for it.

Almost 2 years ago now, I went freelance and asides from occasional travel, I mostly work from the comforts of my home.  When this happened, hubs stopped doing the very minimal tasks around the house that were his responsibilities, dishes (not entire cleanup, JUST dishes, i still have to go behind and do actual cleaning myself), trash, and cleaning the tub every weekend. That's freaking it. I do everything else. I realize working at home means I have more opportunity to do the housework, but I am usually quite busy (busy enough I've thought on taking on someone part time to make basic calls and handling emails), so I don't have as much time as he seems to think I do. As I've gotten busier, I've increased my frequency of requests for him to do his few things and maybe start some things for me as we go (changing laundry loads, managing our kiddo picking up her toys, ect) to no avail. He won't do anything. It's been 3 weeks of not washing soley his clothes in protest, and he's just rewearing dirty clothes some days. It's insane. I tried not picking up his trash around the house, we attracted ants, so I had to, I tried not cleaning the tub, after 4 weeks I finally had to do it because it was disgusting and my kid wanted to bathe, not shower. Just repeat of issues.

Recently he suggested instead of renting, we finally buy a house. As happy as I am that we can financially do so, the houses he looks at are twice the size (and to be fair, we need more space), and all I see is DOUBLE the house work, double the fights, double the resentment. I finally told him last week, we cannot buy a house until you pull the same weight around the house as me. I shouldn't have to hire a maid, which will become a whole effing bill I have to compensate for, when you're perfectly able bodied. He's taken our kid to the park 4 times since she was born, he doesn't do appointments, play dates, school events. He doesn't help around the house, but he has time to play games after work and before, sometimes totally 30-40 hours a week. I don't know how to get it through his head that I'm exhausted of being taken for granted. I am not his mom. I shouldn't have to request, ask, tell, scold, then yell (in that order every time) in order for him to pick his clothes up off the floors, or for him to do dishes, take trash, put the kid to bed, ect.

He got pissed off, saying all I have to do is tell him what to do (which I do, and it sorta progresses to a fight or me doing it myself), hire a maid, or just stop freaking out about it because it's not a big deal, and he doesn't understand why I care so much about a neat and tidy house. I disengaged and left to go for a walk, because I wanted to scream. I just don't know how to broach the topic again or deal with this.  He's acting like the talk didn't happen, and he's back to sending me house postings, and not doing sh\*t around the house.

So I'm going to try and keep this short. My husband and I have had our ups and downs, but I still love him very much. Right now though I'm at a point where I feel like a prisoner in my own house.. I'm not looking for justification.. Just unbiased opinions as I know I'm wrong in many ways as well. Now this specific problem was a non issue roughly 5 years ago, I've been a stay at home Mom for 10 years and was perfectly content living the home life ect. The thing is the last couple of years I've wanted to socialize. Find some friends, just talk to real live adult people haha.

There generally isn't an answer just avoidance until he can get upset about me leaving again.. I get it you have to watch the kids for a few hours and they are very busy children..but I'm here all day, I'm tired and I want a break.


 It doesn't make a difference what it is, I wanted to go check out my Sisters property she just purchased and he got so upset.. I rarely ask anymore because i know he'll just get upset or say I don't let him do anything.. I feel torn. He has gone out in the past to work on vehicles with a friend ect. and I did get upset one time because he was gone all day. I still feel bad.. But anytime I ask what he wants to do he avoids answering? I offer suggestions fishing, go for a drive idk (he doesn't have many friends) and it's never met with interest. I'm literally about to lose my mind if I can't go out... I made the mistake of just doing it one day... It was horrible. I got the attitude mixed with silent treatment for a week (don't ask me how that works it just does haha). I almost felt like it was worth it though? Just to talk to people.. it seems silly. 

Well now it's been a few months.. and I just want to go out. He usually wants to come with me for grocery shopping ect so I can't do that. What should I do??? Anyone have experience with this?

,Marriage,"So my wife and I have been going through some stuff lately and she recently told me that she doesn't feel loved by me. I asked her what makes her feel loved and she gave me some examples like surprise love notes, flowers or other little gifts outside of gift occasions, and non-sexual touch like hugs and cutesy kisses on her forehead, etc. For what it's worth, I don't feel loved by her either and the ""some stuff"" that we're going through started when I approached her about it. I've decided that the best way forward is to change the things I can control, so I'm reevaluating the way I show her love and affection. The problem is, I am not very good at the verbal ""words of affirmation"" type of affection.

I am mostly an action-oriented person, which happens to be how I perceive love and affection. My wife, on the other hand, is a talk-oriented person and needs to hear things and be reassured verbally as much (or maybe more, honestly) as she needs to be shown through action. I get that, but I'm a complete idiot when it comes to verbal expressions of love beyond basic ""I love you, babe"" stuff: being on the spot (i.e., ""tell me how much you love me"") stresses me out, I run out of things to say (i.e., I can only write so many love notes before it starts to be repetitive, which makes me feel like it's contrived), and just generally feel awkward about how lame and sappy it all feels to me.

So, all that being said, can those of you who *are* good at ""words of affirmation"" give me an assist? I kind of hate to ask for ideas on the internet because I feel like it should ideally come from the heart, but just getting into the right mental space will, with practice, make me better at loving my wife the way she needs.

Thanks!

TL;DR: need help coming up with ways to love wife with ""Words of Affirmation"" love language.

Edit: For those that are unfamiliar, there is a relationship theory out there called ""Love Languages"" that says that people perceive love and affection in different ways: Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, Physical Touch, Receiving Gifts, and Quality Time.

I asked her what makes her feel loved and she gave me some examples like surprise love notes, flowers or other little gifts outside of gift occasions, and non-sexual touch like hugs and cutesy kisses on her forehead, etc. For what it&amp;#39;s worth, I don&amp;#39;t feel loved by her either and the &amp;quot;some stuff&amp;quot; that we&amp;#39;re going through started when I approached her about it. I&amp;#39;ve decided that the best way forward is to change the things I can control, so I&amp;#39;m reevaluating the way I show her love and affection. The problem is, I am not very good at the verbal &amp;quot;words of affirmation&amp;quot; type of affection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am mostly an action-oriented person, which happens to be how I perceive love and affection. My wife, on the other hand, is a talk-oriented person and needs to hear things and be reassured verbally as much (or maybe more, honestly) as she needs to be shown through action. I get that, but I&amp;#39;m a complete idiot when it comes to verbal expressions of love beyond basic &amp;quot;I love you, babe&amp;quot; stuff: being on the spot (i.e., &amp;quot;tell me how much you love me&amp;quot;) stresses me out, I run out of things to say (i.e., I can only write so many love notes before it starts to be repetitive, which makes me feel like it&amp;#39;s contrived), and just generally feel awkward about how lame and sappy it all feels to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all that being said, can those of you who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; good at &amp;quot;words of affirmation&amp;quot; give me an assist? I kind of hate to ask for ideas on the internet because I feel like it should ideally come from the heart, but just getting into the right mental space will, with practice, make me better at loving my wife the way she needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: need help coming up with ways to love wife with &amp;quot;Words of Affirmation&amp;quot; love language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: For those that are unfamiliar, there is a relationship theory out there called &amp;quot;Love Languages&amp;quot; that says that people perceive love and affection in different ways: Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, Physical Touch, Receiving Gifts, and Quality Time. I need help specifically with the Words of Affirmation one.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"This is going to be long, i apologize in advance. Going to try and put as much context out there to give anyone who has been through something similiar the fulk scoop.

Wife &amp; I been married for 7 years. First 7 or 8 months of marriage was great, then for 7 to almost 8 years we had just been ""surviving."" Had a daughter in 2014. Many mistakes on both our parts, most damaging is for over 7 years I never slept in the bed with my wife. Reason for that was pretty much i got off work at midnight and would play video games with my friends. So she went to bed every night with our dog.

About 2 years ago I realized that I was not the man my wife deserves and it hurt. I saw my neglect &amp; selfishness. Knew I needed to change, and so I did. I started by just helping out more with chores &amp; housework. Got to the point where the house was cleaned daily when she came home from work. Changed the way I talked to her and was more careful with my words. Started working out again. Started making her lunch and writing notes for her to find when she ate lunch. Started adding more romance into her life(flowers, notes, surprise date nights). I stopped playing video games when we had an opportunity to spend time together. 

All of this took me almost 2 years to change. I failed some days. I still fail from time to time now, but overall I feel I have made leaps &amp; bounds in making everything better for our life. And she has also acknowledged that. In Feb this year was my biggest challenge, and that was to sleep in the bed with her. So I started going to bed when I felt tired, instead of laying down watching The Office till I fell asleep. It was hard for both of us. She wasnt used to me being in the bed, and I wasnt used to the dog smothering me. It was very up &amp; down for the next 3 months.

But I didnt give up and kept going to bed. Finally after 3 full weeks of sleeping in the bed I felt I had adjusted. But our marriage was still at the same point it was before I started changing. I couldnt figure it out. Nothing had improved between us. Sure she was happier in general, but we were still the same. So after many arguments about this and exploring many possibilities, she finally broke down to tell me that at some point she flipped a switch off. She said for years she went to bed upset or crying because she felt unwanted by me. And at some point she went into survival mode. The dog was the only one there for her, and I wasn't.

Then out of the blue, we found a large inoperable tumor on our dog. He was in a lot of pain and wasn't himself. We had to make the decision to put him down. This destroyed my wife. She started spending money we didnt have to spend, working 60-70 hours a week, and just coming home to go to bed. She has basically abandoned our family. And so after a couple months of this, I told her how I felt and how things looked from my perspective. Maybe the raw harsh truth would wake her up. I was wrong. 

She never wants to talk about anything with me now. Sometimes she will tell me she is having a bad day and just stays in her room watching TV. Sometimes she gives me a random kiss and tells me she wants us to make. Sometimes she tells me she is depressed and feels like nobody loves her and she should just run away. And sometimes she tells me that she doesn't know how to flip her switch back and me sleeping in the bed with her doesnt matter. She slept alone for so long she is indifferent about it. Sometimes she tells me she slept good because I was in the bed with her.

Basically what I am asking, is how do I deal with the mixed feelings. How can I help through this without being overbearing. And how can she see past my mistakes and forgive. I feel like she is stuck on living in the past and doesnt know how to focus on the present or future.

,Marriage,"When my wife and I first met we had been dating a few weeks, falling in love, lots of new relationship energy, and she goes ""Would you ever want to live in (another state)? My mom lives there and I'm hoping to move there some day.""

I said yes because... Not really sure why. I like the state where we live, my family is here my favorite sports teams and restaurants are here, it's an area doing very well economically, we have lakes and forests and live in a very low crime suburb with affordable housing and fiber internet.

Where my MIL lives the climate is much different, no lakes, no woods, not much outdoor activities other than hunting/hiking in the desert, it's a very poor area, and one of the highest crime rates in the country. There's culture/cuisine there but the whole place is sort of economically depressed and boring. MIL is a medical specialist who went there after being headhunted. My wife was living here for grad school.

A note on my wife and MIL. They have a codependent relationship. They love the Gillmore Girls and seem to want to reenact that relationship in real life. While my wife thinks her mom ""calms her down"" the truth is unless her mom is sending us money (more on this later) my MIL spins my wife up more. Both of them, they don't try to assure or calm down the other. They agree with each other to a fault. If my wife calls her mom and says ""I think I'm going to be fired."" Her mom doesn't calm her down and disarm her anxieties, instead she agreed with her ""oh no, watch out, record everything your boss says to you."" Crap like that. But my wife insists her mom is her best friend and has on/off talked about moving across the country to this objectively worse state. I think honestly I assumed it would never happen since my wife never had any concrete plans to move there.

Money, my MIL makes a lot of money and sends a lot to my wife and also will bail us out. For our wedding we had $6,000 in cash but we went on a very expensive honeymoon and a shopping spree and after it was all done we ended up with about $5,000 in credit card debt. We cut up the cards and had a plan to pay it all down. But the interest and the debt was driving my wife guilty so she told her mom who sent us the money. I wasn't consulted and I was pretty upset about it. Because exactly what I was afraid of happened did happen, her mom now comments on exactly everything that we spend money on. We're living within our means but if we go on a Groupon-powered cheap weekend getaway or buy a panini press for 50% off on Amazon, she'll say ""Wow I hope you guys didn't put that on a credit card."" Involving my MIL in our financial life is EXACTLY WHAT I DIDN'T WANT AND EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. She bailed us out once (when we were doing fine) and now she feels she can comment on everything. I understand she is just afraid we're going to ring up debt again and be expected to pay it off again, but this exactly why I thought involving her in our financial life was a fucking terrible idea.

Finally, the move. My wife had a falling out with her best friend/coworker. She had a panic attack and decided that she is sick of great state and wants to move to terrible state to be with her real best friend, her mom. So now we're moving. At the end of our lease. And as were getting closer and closer I am getting more and more frustrated. I don't want to move. The professional field I'm in has almost no opportunities or job listings in our destination city.

I'm worried about moving costs. We are trying to save up a ""move fund"" and housing is cheaper there but crime is high. Even in middle class ""nice"" neighborhoods there's rampant property crimes (even in MIL's gated community there is a rash of house break-ins). And my wife is insistant on a house, not an apartment. I said we cannot afford to rent a nice in the best neighborhood, and she said ""I think my mom will spot us a few months rent until we get settled."" So more money involvement from MIL.

Except, my wife was talking about money listings with her mom and mentioned one we liked for $1,900/month. My MIL goes ""Can you afford that?"" (My wife hates holding the phone up to her face so she has all conversations on speaker phone and I hear all of this).

After the call I asked my wife if she has discussed getting rent help from her mom. ""No, I just assumed she would help.""

I told her it didn't sound like she would help and if we're going to to be planning on her helping our rent costs we need to know that now because that'll drastically change what housing options we're looking at

My wife never asks for money. She just complains about something until her mom offers to send her some. So she never actually has talked to her about rent and her talking about this $1,900/month place was her trying to hint that we need help.

Meanwhile my wife is getting upset that I'm not being more proactive in the moving process. But I. DO. NOT. WANT. TO. GO. So I'm just shutting down. And that is making her mad. We're fighting more. 

I don't know if anybody is actually reading all this but I am mostly just venting.

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile my wife is getting upset that I&amp;#39;m not being more proactive in the moving process. But I. DO. NOT. WANT. TO. GO. So I&amp;#39;m just shutting down. And that is making her mad. We&amp;#39;re fighting more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if anybody is actually reading all this but I am mostly just venting. If anybody has any advice I&amp;#39;m all ears.&lt;/p&gt;

My fiancé and I are getting married Saturday. We have been together for over 2yrs and have only had a minor issue here and there besides one major fight in June. He promised he would fully stop everything and for a while I didn't see any concerns. Tonight I found out he has been lying and he is still continuing his ""visual"" addiction.

,Marriage,"After just over a month of marriage, my husband and I have decided to divorce. While we both have faults, we find them to be incompatible. 

I could really use some input, I feel uncomfortable discussing this situation with loved ones because I’m getting some biased responses like “you’re such a great person, a catch, you can do better”. This bias doesn’t help me to be practical.

My husband is emotionally immature, often blaming just about anything on just about anyone else (including children). Very argumentative. Rarely supportive. Episodes of these behaviors sharply increased after the wedding. I feel like a switch flipped and I don’t know this person anymore. (Don’t worry, I’m not only criticizing him in this post.)

The thing is, he’s not a bad person. There’s just some emotional maturity that needs to happen, and some implementation of healthy conflict resolution strategies. I scheduled marriage counseling, but he said he just didn’t feel like committing to a lifetime of having to “make an effort” to use healthy communication. He’d rather divorce. 

I understand that I could use some work, I don’t respond well to his “temper tantrums” (saying something hurtful and leaving quickly). His communication strategies frustrate me to the extent that I feel like the worst version of myself. He pushes me to my breaking point (intentionally) and then criticizes me for not keeping my cool. He’s a button pusher. But hey, I’m willing to improve my conflict resolution skills, I’m willing to put myself out there to become a better partner. I’m hurt that he’s not willing to do the same. 

I really love this man, and am feeling such grief. I feel like I’m grieving the loss of a person, the person who I fell in love with. When I walk past the room that we planned on being a nursery for the child we planned to have, I feel crushed. When I realize that we will not share life accomplishments together, I feel crushed. I’m grieving the loss of the future I would have shared with this person.

I think things like “if he would just try the marriage counseling then things could improve”, and I understand that my thought is the bargaining stage of grief. The fact is that he doesn’t want to, I can’t make him.

Back to the part where he’s not a bad person. No one is perfect. We all have faults. I have always been under the impression that you just need to find someone with faults that you can live with. I just don’t think I can live with the constant arguing, and immature quips (imagine being married to a teenager). I feel like marriage counseling could address this.  But I suppose he just *wants to be this way*.

I have a fear that I’m being neurotic, and that I’m going to find a bunch of people in the world who have problems. I’m afraid that finding a supportive and respectful partner is impossible. My married friends tell me that some days they are happily married, other days they feel they have made a mistake in choosing a partner. I feel the same waxing and waning feeling. Is this what marriage is? 

Are my expectations too high? My friends think I’m crazy for considering staying married, based on his behavior. I’m struggling because I can see the good in him, and am afraid of making the wrong choice. We chose divorce because we didn’t want things to go too far, to truly hate each other.

,Marriage,"I've had acne for years, and it really only bothers me when I think of the one day soon that I'll be married, and I won't be the only one who has to see it every day, especially the acne across my shoulders, chest, and back.

I have never posted here, and just wanted your input on my situation. 
Background: My wife and I have been married just over four years; we are in our early 30’s, and have had a bit of a bumpy marriage.. We have a son that is almost two years old, and he is basically the only thing that keeps us together. 

When we are home, we are generally in separate rooms doing our own thing. She won’t watch my shows, sports, etc., or she is always on her computer. We very rarely kiss, touch, and sex is non existent. Every time I try to “start” leading to sex, she basically has an excuse. 

I pay 90% of the bills, do all of the yard work, house work, and spend more time with our son. 
I have tried talking to her about all of this, but it always just turns into a fight. I have asked for a divorce on numerous occasions, but she will not agree to it. To be honest, (and I have never been this type of guy) but I am very tempted to cheat.

\- My wife does everything for the kids

\- She goes to bed at 7pm and sit on her cell phone until she falls asleep at 9pm

\- When we talk, I quickly get frustrated with her because I can never get a word in. She steamrolls me and eventually I raise my voice.

\- When we plan things it is always her way or the highway

\- There is sex, once or twice a week but little interaction from her. Does she think she is doing me a favour?

\- She bars visitors from coming to our house, kids aren't allowed to have birthday parties, won't get along with my mother (no one else has problems with her)

\- She won't bother with counselling, she doesn't need advice from strangers.

,Marriage,"Okay. I’m not sure where to post this so here it is anyway. 

I don’t want this to be toooo long winded so please just take what I say at face value.  I’m being candid and honest here. Trying my best to explain short and sweet so I can get some answers. Hopefully ease my mind and log out forever. I wouldn’t want my husband to see this, not out of any fear whatsoever. But because I honestly don’t want him to feel even worse about this. 

Here goes nothing. 

Our relationship started out perfect and oddly so. Things happened. Life did things to me. Things out of my control by any means and it hurt us. I started to be emotionally abusive. And this is behavior that has been worked on and solved. And what I’m asking for advice on has also been buried with my husband. As I honestly think he deserves and I honestly want it for us. He forgave me for a lot too. 

It may sound backwards to you but he truly respects me. These things happened in a window of time. They haven’t happened since. We have been in a good place for about a year now. Our relationship is very healthy now. It’s a 180. I started medication and that helped. Therapy helped. We’re good is my point. Very good. So this isn’t an us thing anymore...it’s a me thing now. That’s how I prefer it. 

Anyway. Now that we’ve been so good and everything is healthy. I remembered what it was like not too long ago. And then I remembered an old issue. And here I am asking for help. For permission from strangers that it’s okay move on.

My husband had anal sex with me once or maybe twice. I honestly can’t recall. I was very drunk and he was pretty buzzed. I didn’t stop the sex. He cleaned up and we went back to vaginal. 

He used to touch my ass with his finger all the time. Even put it in. I never said it was okay to put anything in. I never enjoyed it at all. Sometimes I allowed the touching and sometimes he’d take it further. 

Now I feel like what is keeping me from truly getting over this this feeling the need to post. Is that I feel like I’m not allowed to? Like it’s not okay? Today’s society is so...well. You know. Progressive. I feel like it’s wrong to forgive my husband for this. 

He’s truly changed. He hasn’t made me sexually uncomfortable in a year or so. He didn’t  manipulate or intimidate me. He pushed boundaries time and time again. He wasn’t violent or hateful or anything else. 

He’s very very in tune with me now. We have no problems in this department now. This really truly is a thing that happened for a time. And then it ended. And yes. I know it’s cliche to say it and reddit may groan but he was a really fantastic partner even then. That’s what makes these transgressions extra surprising. He is a calm patient man. Outside of these moments, he is thoughtful. He is emotional and tender. Blah blah. This is the internet and my word is only of so much value to you- so please just answer me like you believe me even if you don’t because I’ve put tons of thought into this recently and I’m not being delusional or dumb or whatever else may seem. 

 I have this that I keep pretty secret because I just...well it’s complicated. This is the best I can do just blurting it out with no editing and much more thought...

I just feel upset with myself that I never really put my foot down and it happened so much. I know that is victim blaming. But what I mean is. I wish I stopped having sex with him without change back then. The past is filled with many regrets.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Now that we’ve been so good and everything is healthy. I remembered what it was like not too long ago. And then I remembered an old issue. And here I am asking for help. For permission from strangers that it’s okay move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband had anal sex with me once or maybe twice. I honestly can’t recall. I was very drunk and he was pretty buzzed. I didn’t stop the sex. He cleaned up and we went back to vaginal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He used to touch my ass with his finger all the time. Even put it in. I never said it was okay to put anything in. I never enjoyed it at all. Sometimes I allowed the touching and sometimes he’d take it further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I feel like what is keeping me from truly getting over this this feeling the need to post. Is that I feel like I’m not allowed to? Like it’s not okay? Today’s society is so...well. You know. Progressive. I feel like it’s wrong to forgive my husband for this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s truly changed. He hasn’t made me sexually uncomfortable in a year or so. He didn’t  manipulate or intimidate me. He pushed boundaries time and time again. He wasn’t violent or hateful or anything else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s very very in tune with me now. We have no problems in this department now. This really truly is a thing that happened for a time. And then it ended. And yes. I know it’s cliche to say it and reddit may groan but he was a really fantastic partner even then. That’s what makes these transgressions extra surprising. He is a calm patient man. Outside of these moments, he is thoughtful. He is emotional and tender. Blah blah. This is the internet and my word is only of so much value to you- so please just answer me like you believe me even if you don’t because I’ve put tons of thought into this recently and I’m not being delusional or dumb or whatever else may seem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this that I keep pretty secret because I just...well it’s complicated. This is the best I can do just blurting it out with no editing and much more thought...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel upset with myself that I never really put my foot down and it happened so much. I know that is victim blaming. But what I mean is. I wish I stopped having sex with him without change back then. The past is filled with many regrets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you if you read it&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Apologies in advance, this will be a LONG post: So my wife’s first high school beau was a piece of shit.(IMO) This girl was my wife’s first girlfriend and love in high school. They were trying to figure out their sexuality, and it ended on more-than-usual bad terms. Basically my wife’s ex broke up with her because she was scared her religious parents would find out and then proceeded to make her feel like shit, and turn all of their mutual friends against my wife. It was extremely emotionally damaging for my wife and has resulted in a ton of issues that I’ve help her work through in our 5 years together. 

Well, said ex decided to message my wife out of the blue last week and offer up a conveniently time apology, which just so happened to coincide with the ex getting out of an extremely abusive relationship. 

Now I’ll admit I’m not the most trusting person, but it’s been well founded in previous relationship experiences. Every time I’ve allowed a current partner to reach out to an ex because said ex wants to “rekindle the friendship”, I’ve been burned.  

But are my fears a bit more founded this time? I’m worried, not so much about physical  cheating (yet), but the beginnings of emotional cheating. Here’s what’s been going on the last week.

1.) About a week ago on Tues, my wife told me that ex messaged her, and she wanted to talk to her “just to get closure.” I said ok, I was fully on board with that because it might help our relationship, and some of her deep seated self-image issues. 

2.) The very next day my wife surprised me by saying that she and her ex had a “date” (partner’s words, not mine) set for that Friday to meet up and sit down and talk. Her ex wanted her to “meet her family..” (ex’s EXACT wording) I was hesitant, and my wife said she’d cancel if I felt worried. But these issues have been so bad for our relationship, and I’ve stuck with her through so many ups and downs that I told her to go, and get the support and closure she needed. She said she was just going to dinner for an hour or two and then she’d see me at home after I got out of work that night.

3.) We went out with some friends on Thursday night and had dinner. The entire time she’s on her phone and EXTREMELY careful not to let me see anything she’s messaging on Facebook. This last the entire three hour dinner. I try to let it go, figuring it’s more unloading of her emotional difficulties stem from her ex, to her ex. But when my friends notice and ask, she explains what she’s doing. Then my one friend says “Ah, you always have to be careful about digging up old high school relationships. Those are usually deeply emotional ties, and a lot of people end up going back to their high school partner at least a few times during other relationships.” I know he was trying to make light, but my wife just laughs a little, and looks back at her phone. 

4.) Friday comes, and my wife messaged me (I was at work) saying she was leaving for her ex’s and then messaged again letting me know she got their safe. Ex’s place is about 20 mins away from where we live, and about 40 mins away from my work. I didn’t think anything of it, due to work, and figured I see her when I got home. She got to her ex’s place around 6.

I get home around 5:30 and relax. Pop in a movie and grab a drink, and dinner. It wasn’t until it started getting dark that I even realized time had passed so quickly. I look at my watch and it’s almost 10p, and my wife isn’t home and I’ve heard no word from her. I start to feel antsy, but I try to let it go. 

Then I get a FB call a few minutes later. She’s on her way home. When she makes it home, I ask how it went, and she said it went “really good.” That’s when the gut punch happens. I smell alcohol on her breath. Now, I wouldn’t be so upset but my wife has a drinking problem we’ve been working on. She drinks to up her “sexual confidence” when she’s feeling low. She also can’t keep her hands to herself. I’ve been trying to guide her towards other means of support, including myself. It all goes back to issues stemming from this ex. I also told her multiple times previously that she shouldn’t drink and drive, because she’s not the best driver. I tell her I’m upset with her and she says “I knew you’d react this way.” and immediately gets defensive. She downs another shot, and goes to bed. 

5.) The next morning we apologize, and I’m heading to work when I hear my wife’s iPad chime. I notice on the lock screen that her “friend” had messaged her and had said “Good morning, I hope you slept well.” I’m not proud of it, but I got curious. I looked through her FB messages and my partner’s been sharing details of her daily life with this girl. Not just “work was boring” stuff, but personal stuff about us, and our lives. Pictures of our cats, their personalities, pictures of our house, how she’s feeling at work, when she’s emotionally tired, or feeling insecure. She’s sharing details about when we go out with friends, when I’m at work. They’re wishing each other “sweet dreams” at night, and messaging as soon as they wake up in the morning. I feel like it’s only going to get more intense if I let it go on, but I don’t want to be the asshole and tell my wife to drop a friendship that (if it’s ONLY a friendship) could help her heal. But I definitely get the feeling that this girl is in it for more than that.

They were trying to figure out their sexuality, and it ended on more-than-usual bad terms. Basically my wife’s ex broke up with her because she was scared her religious parents would find out and then proceeded to make her feel like shit, and turn all of their mutual friends against my wife. It was extremely emotionally damaging for my wife and has resulted in a ton of issues that I’ve help her work through in our 5 years together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, said ex decided to message my wife out of the blue last week and offer up a conveniently time apology, which just so happened to coincide with the ex getting out of an extremely abusive relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’ll admit I’m not the most trusting person, but it’s been well founded in previous relationship experiences. Every time I’ve allowed a current partner to reach out to an ex because said ex wants to “rekindle the friendship”, I’ve been burned.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are my fears a bit more founded this time? I’m worried, not so much about physical  cheating (yet), but the beginnings of emotional cheating. Here’s what’s been going on the last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) About a week ago on Tues, my wife told me that ex messaged her, and she wanted to talk to her “just to get closure.” I said ok, I was fully on board with that because it might help our relationship, and some of her deep seated self-image issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) The very next day my wife surprised me by saying that she and her ex had a “date” (partner’s words, not mine) set for that Friday to meet up and sit down and talk. Her ex wanted her to “meet her family..” (ex’s EXACT wording) I was hesitant, and my wife said she’d cancel if I felt worried. But these issues have been so bad for our relationship, and I’ve stuck with her through so many ups and downs that I told her to go, and get the support and closure she needed. She said she was just going to dinner for an hour or two and then she’d see me at home after I got out of work that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) We went out with some friends on Thursday night and had dinner. The entire time she’s on her phone and EXTREMELY careful not to let me see anything she’s messaging on Facebook. This last the entire three hour dinner. I try to let it go, figuring it’s more unloading of her emotional difficulties stem from her ex, to her ex. But when my friends notice and ask, she explains what she’s doing. Then my one friend says “Ah, you always have to be careful about digging up old high school relationships. Those are usually deeply emotional ties, and a lot of people end up going back to their high school partner at least a few times during other relationships.” I know he was trying to make light, but my wife just laughs a little, and looks back at her phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.) Friday comes, and my wife messaged me (I was at work) saying she was leaving for her ex’s and then messaged again letting me know she got their safe. Ex’s place is about 20 mins away from where we live, and about 40 mins away from my work. I didn’t think anything of it, due to work, and figured I see her when I got home. She got to her ex’s place around 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get home around 5:30 and relax. Pop in a movie and grab a drink, and dinner. It wasn’t until it started getting dark that I even realized time had passed so quickly. I look at my watch and it’s almost 10p, and my wife isn’t home and I’ve heard no word from her. I start to feel antsy, but I try to let it go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I get a FB call a few minutes later. She’s on her way home. When she makes it home, I ask how it went, and she said it went “really good.” That’s when the gut punch happens. I smell alcohol on her breath. Now, I wouldn’t be so upset but my wife has a drinking problem we’ve been working on. She drinks to up her “sexual confidence” when she’s feeling low. She also can’t keep her hands to herself. I’ve been trying to guide her towards other means of support, including myself. It all goes back to issues stemming from this ex. I also told her multiple times previously that she shouldn’t drink and drive, because she’s not the best driver. I tell her I’m upset with her and she says “I knew you’d react this way.” and immediately gets defensive. She downs another shot, and goes to bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.) The next morning we apologize, and I’m heading to work when I hear my wife’s iPad chime. I notice on the lock screen that her “friend” had messaged her and had said “Good morning, I hope you slept well.” I’m not proud of it, but I got curious. I looked through her FB messages and my partner’s been sharing details of her daily life with this girl. Not just “work was boring” stuff, but personal stuff about us, and our lives. Pictures of our cats, their personalities, pictures of our house, how she’s feeling at work, when she’s emotionally tired, or feeling insecure. She’s sharing details about when we go out with friends, when I’m at work. They’re wishing each other “sweet dreams” at night, and messaging as soon as they wake up in the morning. I feel like it’s only going to get more intense if I let it go on, but I don’t want to be the asshole and tell my wife to drop a friendship that (if it’s ONLY a friendship) could help her heal. But I definitely get the feeling that this girl is in it for more than that. The ex mentioned how she’s “always thought about you” to my wife and my wife replied how the ex has “never been far from her thoughts”. I don’t know what to do. :/ Any advice? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR My wife might be emotionally cheating on me with an extremely influential ex, and I don’t know how to approach the situation?&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"I have been married to my wife for about 6 years now and for the most part have had a perfectly happy marriage. I work in Silicon Valley for a well-known tech company am blessed with a very exciting job with above-average income and frequent travel. The company I work for has very high standards for employment so most of my coworkers are extremely smart, successful, and extroverted. Because of this my wife tends to question me a lot when I travel, asking things like who’s traveling with me and do I plan to go out in the evenings with coworkers, etc. My particular job requires a lot of relationship building which does tend to lead to frequent dinners and social events. 

I consider myself to be extremely good at maintaining boundaries but on occasion I’ve been in certain scenarios that I’ve purposefully hid from my wife simply because it *could* be interpreted the wrong way. For example, I was at a work event and a female coworker saw me waiting for a Lyft and insisted she take me to my hotel. I obliged, we talked about work, and then I got dropped off. Nothing happened. A few weeks later I was in NYC and had a late-night dinner with a female coworker who needed work advice. Again, nothing happened. Both times however when I got home my wife poked around with questions and I purposefully left those scenarios out simply because I knew she would get upset and assume there’s more to it. She’s done it before. 

Am I wrong for leaving that out if I’m not doing anything wrong? I’ve tried isolating myself at work and being socially “unavailable” but it’s actually led to leadership actually confronting me about it in an annual review.

,Marriage,"My husband and I got married about a month ago. Things in our lives changed quickly, as we moved in together, bought our first house and then tied the knot within a 3 month timeframe.

Since we have been married, things have been great! Marriage to me feels generally the same, just a little sweeter. Like I already had a pan of warm, gooey brownies, and marriage is just the sweet chocolate frosting on top! 

However, I’ve been struggling internally with my new role as a wife. Of course, as I’m sure many other women have done before me, I’ve been burning the candle at both ends trying to be the “super-wife”. I’m excited about our marriage, I’m excited for our new home and it seems that everything outside of that has taken a backseat lately. It’s of my own doing- I want to take care of my husband because he works so hard to give us everything that we need. 

But so do I. I work full time, I’m a full time online student, and now I’m a wife. As much as I want to be a great wife, I also want to be a great employee and a great student. I’ve been staying up too late through the week working on the house, and that causes me to have trouble getting up in the morning, making me rushed to get to work and feeling crabby. I’ve been tired after giving my all at work all day, so some days I’ve come home and slept instead of studying or working on schoolwork. I’ve been feeling guilty about slacking a bit in some of my other roles.

So I brought this up to my husband today in the car as we were on a lengthy drive. He told me understands completely because he is carrying the same load on his shoulders that I am (full time student, full time job, and now husband). He told me it’s okay if sometimes one role needs to take priority over another role, and he hopes that I understand if he has to make the same choices from time to time. He told me that I don’t have to put my role as wife above all the other roles in my life, roles that are equally as important to me. He told me that one reason that he fell in love with me in the first place is because I am so comfortable with being an individual, having my own goals, ambitions and interests. He told me that seeing me happy and succeed in areas outside of our marriage makes him happy too, and he’s thankful that he can support me through this busy time in our lives.

So this is my “AHA!” moment. Yes, I want to be a great wife. But I also want to be a great teacher and a great student on my journey to getting there. So if that means ordering pizza one night instead of making a grand homemade meal because I’m tired after work, then I’m going to order pizza. If that means that the laundry hamper gets a little fuller than I’d like so that I can get to bed at a decent hour, I’m going to let pile up without feeling like a failure. If that means I decide to stay up late and have a glass of wine with my husband on a work night, it’s okay if I’m a little slow getting in gear in the morning. I’m not watering just one flower, I’m tending to a garden of different flowers with different needs, and they all need my love.

So I wanted to throw this out there for anyone else who may be struggling with this. For me, while being a wife is by far my favorite role so far, it isn’t the “end-all-be-all”- and that’s OKAY! I’m proud to have other roles, and I realize now that it’s okay to water those roles too so they continue to grow with along with me.",t2_11plm96e,False,,0,False,My 1 month post-wedding realization,[],r/Marriage,False,6,,0,,False,t3_d4shzw,False,dark,,public,15,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,15,,self,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1568619288.0,text,6,,text,self.Marriage,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband and I got married about a month ago.

,Marriage,"So my husband (25m) and I (26f) have been dating/married for going on 5 years. He is truly my best friend in the world and I love him to pieces. I firmly believe he feels the same way, as he always makes it a point to make sure I know and feel loved.  


My main problem that I am trying to desperately to overcome is a twinge of mistrust. He's a naturally flirty guy and for many years, it never bothered me because he always came home to me. This year has been much different since my husband got a new job. He works with predominately females. Sometimes when he comes home, he talks about funny things they talk about at work and some of it makes me feel kind of uncomfortable. In my job field, it's natural for conversations to turn sexual, but I usually find myself uncomfortable in those situations too because I don't want the personal details of my relationship out there for people to analyze.   


He recently came home and told me about himself and a couple of the girls at work playing Fuck, Marry, Kill and I got really uneasy about it. Previously when he came home and talked about work, he talks about conversations he has with some of his coworkers and its about a lot of things that he and I don't really talk about. (For my gamer friends, he plays ARK pretty frequently) and I haven't gotten into it, but he's been talking a lot with this girl at work who is as obsessed as he is and shares a ton of interests with him.) I admit that my self-esteem is not the greatest so I've been comparing myself with some of these girls and there's this one who legit I swear could be a swimsuit model. My husband is a very attractive guy and combined with his natural flirty personality, I'm having a hard time.

He is truly my best friend in the world and I love him to pieces. I firmly believe he feels the same way, as he always makes it a point to make sure I know and feel loved.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main problem that I am trying to desperately to overcome is a twinge of mistrust. He&amp;#39;s a naturally flirty guy and for many years, it never bothered me because he always came home to me. This year has been much different since my husband got a new job. He works with predominately females. Sometimes when he comes home, he talks about funny things they talk about at work and some of it makes me feel kind of uncomfortable. In my job field, it&amp;#39;s natural for conversations to turn sexual, but I usually find myself uncomfortable in those situations too because I don&amp;#39;t want the personal details of my relationship out there for people to analyze.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He recently came home and told me about himself and a couple of the girls at work playing Fuck, Marry, Kill and I got really uneasy about it. Previously when he came home and talked about work, he talks about conversations he has with some of his coworkers and its about a lot of things that he and I don&amp;#39;t really talk about. (For my gamer friends, he plays ARK pretty frequently) and I haven&amp;#39;t gotten into it, but he&amp;#39;s been talking a lot with this girl at work who is as obsessed as he is and shares a ton of interests with him.) I admit that my self-esteem is not the greatest so I&amp;#39;ve been comparing myself with some of these girls and there&amp;#39;s this one who legit I swear could be a swimsuit model. My husband is a very attractive guy and combined with his natural flirty personality, I&amp;#39;m having a hard time. It&amp;#39;s probably just me, and I know he meant no harm but I&amp;#39;ve starting realizing that I&amp;#39;m getting scared that he&amp;#39;ll connect with someone else on a level that he hasn&amp;#39;t with me.

,Marriage,"I’ve been with my fiancé for about 4 years now and will be getting married at the end of this year. There has been a lot of bumps along the road. I have been having second thoughts about our marriage. I feel like whenever I talk to him about how I am feeling, it always ends up in a fight. I feel like I can’t express myself to him at all without him getting mad or upset. I feel like I can’t talk to him. Instead of making me feel better after talking to him, I feel ten times worse. I know I can be overly sensitive and emotional as well. 

There are moments when he releases his anger by hitting walls, jumping on my car, throwing my car keys in the road, trying to break my laptop, etc. Is this acceptable behavior that can get better or will only get worse? I’m not sure if I’m at fault as well for his behavior. Am I causing it or contributing to it? Is this normal? It definitely scares me when he acts that way because I would never do anything to hurt him purposefully. I’m even scared if he may even try to hit me one day.... I recommended for both of us to go to couples therapy. The first therapist said we should cancel our wedding and the second one said we should work it out. I feel trapped. Our wedding is a destination wedding and I feel like I’m only going thru with it because so many people invested their money and time to coming. I will feel so embarrassed calling off the wedding...

We never lived together after all these years being together which I wanted for so long. He was always reluctant and hesitant about it since he lived with his mother who catered to his every need. I had to fight so hard about it and ended up giving him an ultimatum just for it to happen. We are supposed to move out next month. Even when we talk about our future place, he still says “you wanted it” instead of “we.” It hurts me a lot and it feels like it’s one sided. I’m scared. 

Another thing is that he has a big stocking and heel fetish which I discovered early on in our relationship. I thought I could be ok with it over time but I haven’t been completely comfortable with it. At first, he made it seem like he only wanted me to wear it. He then surprised me several times later on in our relationship when he actually wore stockings and heels. It makes me feel like I’m with a woman when he does that?  He makes me feel bad when I am uncomfortable with it by saying things like, “I always wanted my future wife to enjoy this as much as I did.” I am more ok with me wearing it than him wearing it and it does make me feel like there’s a lot of pressure on me to fulfill his needs. 

Lastly, I realized that I suddenly have a crush on a co worker of mine. It started when I would have random dreams about him even though I never interacted with him. I thought it was odd or like a sign. We then did start talking here and there over these past months. To me, he seems like a calm, smart, funny, nice guy that I can possibly imagine myself with. I know this is emotionally cheating and I do feel guilty about it. I told my fiancé and he said he’s ok with me talking to him as long as I don’t physically cheat. I feel a strong attraction to him. I get nervous and get butterflies. I can’t help but think he may feel the same way? I’m not sure if I should just stop or continue this. I look forward to getting to know him.

,Marriage,"*UPDATE*
I told him I wish I pleased him etc and he said I do. IF I did he wouldn't want to go to strip clubs. 


***UPDATE***told him that I think it's wrong for people who are married to do this and he didn't say anything. So then I'm like I guess you're the type of person who thinks going to a strip club while married is ok. Hasn't responded to that either.


I apologize as this will be long but I need to vent somewhere.

As wrong as it was for me to snoop what I found out is even worse.
Its a huge blow to my ego and extremely hurtful to me. I haven't told him yet and honestly I don't know how I will.
I still can't believe that is apparently how his mind works.
Background: My husband and I will have been married for 11 years next month. I'm 32(F) he's 41(M). The begiining of the relationship was great. While sex hasn't been the greatest because it happens as frequently as he wants it which isn't very much at all,enough to it be catigorized as a DB.
Its hurtful that when I'm in the mood hes not. He spends hours playing his video games(and it hurts). Ive talked to him about it and he apologizes but shit goes back to the way it was almost immediately.
I'm always initiating sex and it usually doesn't take much to get him in the mood.

I've expressed how I am hurt that it seems like hes only interested in being intimate with me when HE wants to not when I do.

Now here comes the huge blow to my ego and why I don't think its ok at all so I want other opinions.

He used to do this with a guy friend before we met. Anyways I found out that he was talking to the same guy friend about how my husbands(we will call him Mike;Husband) friend(we will call him Steve;my husbands friend) was going to a strip club with other guy friends etc and they didnt really want to go. So Mike told Steve that they should go again someday (like was said I guess they went to strip clubs before I met Mike,idk how recently they've went after we married). Then Mike says that Steve should tell his 2 friends that they should go because Mike is stuck in another state and can't go.

Um he's married. How is this even a thing for married men to WANT to go to strip clubs. I could see if the wife and husband went together but thats not the case here. And I didnt know he even said this until I peeked(honestly wish I never did). So Steve then says that there is a casino next door. But that Mike told this to his friend Steve makes me sick to my stomach and so hurt. My ego is crushed. Makes me feel so unloved and ugly.
Yes I have read something that says guys go because of the view. He has a view here. Makes me feel so worthless that he wants to go to a strip club and see women he isn't married to so he can put dollars in their panties.

And I found this out AFTER I had sex with him,which just makes me wish I never had sex with him. I feel so disrespected. A married man should not be touching other women and going to see a view(obviously a better view to them) when they have a very loyal wife at home who should be getting the attention.

Then Steve told Mike that there was a casino next door. Then Mike says the casino is a good consolation prize at least.


I don't know what I should do. I am just so hurt by all of this etc that I haven't been able to look at him all day. And you know what Mike will just be mad at the fact I looked at his phone NOT that he's hurt my feelings by what he said.

I still can&amp;#39;t believe that is apparently how his mind works.
Background: My husband and I will have been married for 11 years next month. I&amp;#39;m 32(F) he&amp;#39;s 41(M). The begiining of the relationship was great. While sex hasn&amp;#39;t been the greatest because it happens as frequently as he wants it which isn&amp;#39;t very much at all,enough to it be catigorized as a DB.
Its hurtful that when I&amp;#39;m in the mood hes not. He spends hours playing his video games(and it hurts). Ive talked to him about it and he apologizes but shit goes back to the way it was almost immediately.
I&amp;#39;m always initiating sex and it usually doesn&amp;#39;t take much to get him in the mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve expressed how I am hurt that it seems like hes only interested in being intimate with me when HE wants to not when I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here comes the huge blow to my ego and why I don&amp;#39;t think its ok at all so I want other opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He used to do this with a guy friend before we met. Anyways I found out that he was talking to the same guy friend about how my husbands(we will call him Mike;Husband) friend(we will call him Steve;my husbands friend) was going to a strip club with other guy friends etc and they didnt really want to go. So Mike told Steve that they should go again someday (like was said I guess they went to strip clubs before I met Mike,idk how recently they&amp;#39;ve went after we married). Then Mike says that Steve should tell his 2 friends that they should go because Mike is stuck in another state and can&amp;#39;t go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um he&amp;#39;s married. How is this even a thing for married men to WANT to go to strip clubs. I could see if the wife and husband went together but thats not the case here. And I didnt know he even said this until I peeked(honestly wish I never did). So Steve then says that there is a casino next door. But that Mike told this to his friend Steve makes me sick to my stomach and so hurt. My ego is crushed. Makes me feel so unloved and ugly.
Yes I have read something that says guys go because of the view. He has a view here. Makes me feel so worthless that he wants to go to a strip club and see women he isn&amp;#39;t married to so he can put dollars in their panties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I found this out AFTER I had sex with him,which just makes me wish I never had sex with him. I feel so disrespected. A married man should not be touching other women and going to see a view(obviously a better view to them) when they have a very loyal wife at home who should be getting the attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Steve told Mike that there was a casino next door. Then Mike says the casino is a good consolation prize at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what I should do. I am just so hurt by all of this etc that I haven&amp;#39;t been able to look at him all day. And you know what Mike will just be mad at the fact I looked at his phone NOT that he&amp;#39;s hurt my feelings by what he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, you’re essentially going there to pay women to show you their ass,t*tties and vag. Which IMO is NOT okay when you&amp;#39;re married.&lt;/p&gt;

My depression over the past few weeks has been debilitating. So much so that I barely eat, sleep, have been chain-smoking, and drinking.

,Marriage," Me \[25M\] and my fiance \[24F\] have been together since almost March of 2016. We're madly in love, we've been in love, and we will be in love, but right now we're in a bit of a disagreement. 

We had sex for the first time \~ 6 months after we stated dating. My fiance is very religious (I'm not), and it's always been hard for her to have sex before marriage (I'm her first time and one and only). She does not use birth control out of fear o f reproductive harm or adverse health effects, so I've always used a condom. We've had sex \~1/week for the 3 years on and off. Fast forward to now, and we're both in law school while working most of the day. She lives apart from me and can never stay at my place because her parents are very religious as well, so we're almost never alone, and we only are at the same house maybe 3-4 times/week.

Last month we had sex and the condom broke. She was very distressed and we had to run to take Plan B. She was almost assured she was pregnant, in tears, and very emotionally distraught due to fear of becoming pregnant and ruining our upcoming wedding/disappointing her parents. I drove her and we purchased Plan B that night, she had her period, and we're ok. However, she does not want to have sex for the next nine months coming to the wedding. Initially, I agreed, due in large part to the emotional turmoil I was experiencing due to her distress, but yesterday I told her frankly that if we don't have sex for the next nine months I believe that's unhealthy for our relationship and something that will make me grow to resent her. I find sex to be a nice activity not only for the physical sensation, but there's something about the pair bonding that I feel cannot be experienced by say, a blowjob or something similar. She was upset at my comments and believes I do not sympathize with her emotional plight/ I'm being too pushy. However, I feel like it's best I be honest with her because I find sex important in a relationship and something that I greatly cherish in ours. I know that if we don't have sex for nine months I will slowly grow to resent what I feel like is being needlessly withheld, and not shared. Last addition would be that she is not a very sexual person, and often times finds non-sexual things more pleasing than sex itself, such as massages or watching movies together. I try to give her oral pleasure or stimulate with my hands, but it's not something she finds much enjoyment in. 

Any and all advice on whether my comments were inappropriate, who's in the wrong, if someone is being unreasonable, would be appreciated. At the end of the day, the decision is always hers to make.

,Marriage,"She and I have been going through a bit of a rough patch. She’s a bit depressed, a bit overweight, often too tired to do anything productive. She works part time and mostly takes care of her daughter, 14, who has some special needs. She has been drinking a lot, too, although we are taking a break from alcohol right now - 4 weeks doing that, intermittent fasting and eating vegetarian.

We got married 5 years ago which was amazing for the first couple years but we both realized around the 2.5 year mark that here we were together but have very different approaches to navigating the world. 

About a year ago we entered a debt consolidation program, which has turned out to be good and bad - the good part is it forced us to talk openly about what we are spending money on and what are needs versus wants. The bad part is, without any credit cards anymore, we’ve had some tense and stressful situations because quite literally we needed something but didn’t have the money for it. Working things like this out has not been easy but in a lot of ways our relationship has improved. At least it feels like we are beginning to rebuild. 

I’ve made some really bad decisions which haven’t helped matters, and she comes from an abusive past, which I am working on being better about supporting in every way that I can. I’m also taking steps on my own, like joining a men’s group and going to a dharma recovery group once a week. Both of these have helped me a lot, but she hasn’t done much with her situation.

Yesterday evening and this morning we successfully replaced two old bathroom faucets together. I found them on Tanga.com of all places, researched the brand and found them more than twice the price online with plenty of 4 and 5 star reviews. The shipment arrived last Thursday and we set out to make sure we both knew how to do the replacement. For me, that consisted of calling my dad on speaker with my wife present - he’s basically an on demand YouTube video for anything home improvement related, mainly because he’s been a (self-described) cheap SOB his whole life. Very accurate. 

Armed with the knowledge of how to do it and me with stress reduction techniques from both of my groups, we started taking everything apart and figuring it out together. She would hand me tools and hold the flashlights, guide me from above, and kept everything teed up for the next step. It took about 2 hours to do the first one last night, and only about 30 minutes this morning to do the second one. I had to go to Home Depot this morning to get a basin wrench to tighten things down (TIL there’s a thing called a basin wrench). No leaks, and what a blessing to have faucets that work again.

All in all, when we finished the job and put everything away, she gave me a high-five, said “great job, babe!” And we hugged and kissed. It was the first time in a long time I’ve seen her genuinely smile about a sense of accomplishment for something she did, or something we did together. Later she said online the nationwide average for replacing a bathroom faucet is around $275. So she was proud to have saved about $400.

I just felt like posting here to share the story and say that working things out, getting out of your comfort zone, and working together to solve a problem and save money turns out to be very therapeutic. Not to mention we saved money by not going out on Friday night or Saturday morning.

,Marriage,"My husband thinks the way my family mourns is “crap.” He said he’s never going to like it (but who likes mourning?) and his opinion will never change. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I can’t help but feel hurt by it. 

As a little background, my parents and grandparents immigrated to the United States many many years ago. A lot of customs were brought over so a lot of these traditions are all I have ever known. When a family member passes, we wear bands around our heads to signify that we are in mourning. Several days are spent for an open casket visitation and prayers, followed by a funeral mass and Christian burial. I have a very big family so I have been to many funerals growing up. My husband has only been to one when he was little and the body was cremated. We both would like to be cremated when the time comes.

My great aunt recently passed away so I asked my husband to attend the funeral with me. He said yes but then got really worked up about it, saying that “dancing around a corpse is disrespectful” when that is not how it is at all. He said he would never participate in that and he thinks it’s wrong. This upset me because everyone mourns differently and there is nothing disrespectful about it. If anything, it’s to pay respects to the dead and say final goodbyes. We talked about it more and he said he didn’t mean to overreact. He said he will always be there for me but he will never “like” it.

We went to the funeral today and I was hurting for the immediate family. One of the daughters was crying loudly during the burial. It was very emotional to see. Later tonight my husband brought up to me how “annoying” it was that she was “wailing to get attention” when I truly don’t think that’s the case at all. He went on about how long and drawn out these funerals are when all you’re doing is putting someone in the ground. I got very upset by how insensitive he was being and I said he has no idea how a loss like this feels. I cannot even begin to imagine how I will feel when my mother dies. I told him to imagine himself mourning over his own mother but he said he’s mature enough to compose himself and not cry publicly in that way.

I find it hurtful because I have a very big family so there will be many more funerals in our lifetime together for people who I care about. I asked him to keep insensitive thoughts like that to himself because frankly I don’t want to hear them. He said he’ll just shut up in the future but that I shouldn’t care what he thinks. He reassured me he will be there for me but all I’ll ever be thinking is how much he hates everything we’re doing. His opinion will always be on the back of my mind for every single funeral we will go to. 

I’m not really sure what I’m trying to accomplish with this post, other than getting this off my mind. At this point we basically agreed to disagree and he doesn’t want to talk about it anymore. If anyone has any insight on how to deal with our differing opinions, I would appreciate it.

EDIT: Thank you guys for all of your feedback. My husband and I had a long talk about it this afternoon and he apologized for being insensitive about it. He said he just hasn’t experienced death of a loved one yet so he doesn’t have a norm. He said he will support me and I can mourn however I need to without judgment.

,Marriage,"My husband (42m) and I (38f) are about to celebrate our 4th anniversary. When we got together 7 years ago, he had a lot of drama in his life surrounding his abusive ex and the two kids he had custody of. He also had two dogs that wreaked havoc on the house and was living in the house he had gotten with his ex, which was poorly maintained and the kids had done a bit of damage in the post-divorce phase.

Thanks to the passing of time, his kids are now out of the house and we don't have any more drama from the ex, the dogs are dead, and we've shifted house twice and now live in exactly the kind of house and neighborhood I've always wanted. We have a 2 year old daughter together.

Hindsight is a B and I can see now how much of a white knight complex I had, thinking I could swoop in and change things. I could be a strong, stable woman in his kids' lives, I could be a rock for him to lean on, I could tidy up all the things that had gotten away from him. I didn't realize at the time that I was expecting him to change quite a bit.  I had idealized him, and thought the only thing holding him back was the weight of all that baggage. 

The reality is that he IS strong and hardworking -- I at least got that much right -- but also seems to have no interest in growth or improvement in either himself, our relationship, our home.

 He won't do things he says he'll do. It's like he agrees with me and says he'll do something just to placate me and then goes on to do whatever he wants. The more this happens, the more upset I get, and then I just get more critical. Then it's like no matter how small something is, it's just one more thing piled on. Obviously, that's not helpful. 

But I've tried explaining to him that if he can't, won't, or doesn't want to do something, to tell me! If something changes so it's not going to happen, tell me! I just want to be able to communicate with each other and be able to trust each other.  I can adjust my expectations. It's not so much the pop cans he leaves out but the fact that I've told him countless times that it bothers me and why it does, and he always says he'll take care of it. And I've told him why it bothers me that he doesn't follow through, but he still doesn't do anything differently. 

It seems like such a minor, stupid thing but it's such a clear example. He asked me to stop leaving my underwear inside my leggings when I put them in the laundry and I consciously think of that every time! I feel like he never consciously thinks of me. Never remembers that we've committed to certain limits and rules with our daughter, to certain chores, whatever. 

I didn't realize how much of a problem this was until our daughter was born and I realized how unheard and unsupported I felt. I've been working through a lot of this with a therapist, and we were in marriage counseling for about 6 months before we moved but now he says he doesn't have time any more to go to counseling with me. 


Lately I've been coping by removing all expectations. I know that everything is up to me. If he said he'll do the dishes and the dishes don't get done, it's because I didn't do them. This has made me feel a lot more peaceful but hasn't done anything for our relationship. 


I don't know what I want here. I guess I just need to say it all out loud, so to speak, though this isn't exactly my first time. I don't have a good IRL place to talk it out and I sometimes can't tell if I'm way out of line. Would any relationship be like this? Is this just the way it is? I have all these projects I want to work on with someone but it doesn't even feel like he's a legit option. I'm really missing that idea of partnership I had hoped for. But maybe it doesn't exist anyway.

Effectively, the One day DH + I have to spend together (opposite work schedules) he’s choosing to spend with [asshole]. He doesn't sound willing to leave. DH invited me to join...said if I was ""out and about"" to ""let him know"". Doesn't sound like he's going to leave them.

I've told DH countless times that unless I HAVE to, I Don't want to be around [asshole]. I've explained How they hurt me (COMPLETELY lied about me to DH, their community; pushed me to having anxiety attacks nearly bi-weekly; basically told me I needed to wear makeup to KEEP my hubby; too much more to tell) and he's still choosing them over me.

I was going to send DH this text but thought, “I’ve tried in the past but this never works 😔 [asshole] is too much of a draw for him”.



 I just want you to know it hurts how consistently you choose the [asshole family] over me.

I understand you were trying to give me space (to do my school work) bc I asked for it.

I realize you cannot be alone. whether it's a fear or a deeply uncomfortable feeling, I have seen that behavior from you, you cannot stand to be alone.

You were going to hang out with the [asshole family] while I was *Working*. Now, you're hanging out with them until After 8 pm (bc the flag ceremony doesn't start until 7).

And what that means is
🚨I don't get to spend any time with you today.🚨

You're going to come home, watch an episode (or three), and go to bed. Where's the connection in that? Where's the ""married"" in that? Where's the love, attention, ""growing together"" in sitting on a dark room watching T.V. then going to sleep? because you keep choosing to spend your free time with the [asshole]. Any free time you have you run to them. 

I'm not trying to make you feel guilty for wanting to be around them. I just don't understand why you want to spend time with people who regularly remind you of your past, pull you back into old (bad) habits, show disrespect to everyone, have caused issues in your marriage, have caused your wife anxiety issues, and have no hesitation to demand you come over and fix their life &amp;amp; belongings.

And you keep running back to them...

It doesn't matter how often or what way I communicate this:

the [asshole family] are your first priority and I am not. I feel I am an accessory to Your life; I am not your Wife; I am not your priority.

He agrees and then she talks about how she loves it when he talks dirty to her...is this something I should be concerned about? I'm trying to picture what it would be like if I did the same thing with a female co worker .....

I found this out by going through her phone. We're going through a rough patch. The confusing part of all this is that she constantly talks about how much she hates her boss but then I see this message and it makes me wonder what else she's lying about. Anyways , I feel like this is not acceptable and this has happened in the past and she swore she has changed so I didn't worry about it until now. Shes not acting the same around me and we're constantly fighting. So I'm not sure if this is just her seeking refuge in another man or if she is genuinely just being flirtatious and sexual. 

Last time I went through her phone it almost made us seperate...not sure how to handle this situation

I&amp;#39;m trying to picture what it would be like if I did the same thing with a female co worker .....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this out by going through her phone. We&amp;#39;re going through a rough patch. The confusing part of all this is that she constantly talks about how much she hates her boss but then I see this message and it makes me wonder what else she&amp;#39;s lying about. Anyways , I feel like this is not acceptable and this has happened in the past and she swore she has changed so I didn&amp;#39;t worry about it until now. Shes not acting the same around me and we&amp;#39;re constantly fighting. So I&amp;#39;m not sure if this is just her seeking refuge in another man or if she is genuinely just being flirtatious and sexual. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I went through her phone it almost made us seperate...not sure how to handle this situation &lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Hey reddit people.

We have been married for 5 years, together 6, (M36, F28) two kids (5 &amp; 3), and four moves. We've had a chaotic relationship that started with major, intense sparks. We jumped in headfirst with little foresight or planning, combined with leftover debt and baggage from both previous relationships. He was still living with his ex when we started spending time together. I still regret this behavior deeply. 

Anyway, we've worked to build a life together and mostly have been happy. Once his career took him on the road things soured. I became resentful and hateful after having both kids and being alone. I didn't have a career at the time beyond an hourly job so I stayed home with the kids. He had an emotional affair/fling after my second came. We almost split up but he begged me to stay, everyone advised me not to hurt my kids by leaving. We have always clashed due to me being less structured and somewhat scatterbrain, just an organized chaos person. I'm kind of an academic nerd so I'd rather have my head in a book than organize my drawer. I would forget to buy x y or z which would throw off the budget and incite his deeply hurt feelings. He's always been a supervisor of sorts so he lives in that headspace often. I get very vocal and angry and rarely hold back when things feel off and disconnected. I probably make things worse by over communication, I feel our life will always be a push and pull between his passion for working all the time and being present and involved with our kids and me. 

We've fought and he's said how bad he feels about being ""irrelevant"" to the kids but I cannot change that. I feel awful saying it but he has disappointed me as a father. He is not a bad father, just not enough of one at all. Is it wrong to hate that he would rather work overtime for no extra pay instead of taking the kids to the park in the early evening? Or that he won't make time once in a while to surprise the kids by picking them up or by seeing them at lunch?

I've literally fainted at home before and been freaked out while sick, but got no concern or attempt to make time to support me. 

I am cold and angry right now. Also not helpful. I'm tired of false promises. I am in such a gridlock. We discussed how we feel we just don't make each other happy anymore. We both agreed it feels that way. I am currently in college preparing to apply to a nursing program in the next year. I can't even be excited about that because I don't trust in his ability to support the family while I pursue that.

It has been three days since my husband has come home at a reasonable enough hour for me to see him or engage with him. Tuesday he worked until midnight, came home and watched TV and drank some wine by himself. Wednesday he claimed he was working late but I saw through snooping on his phone that he was sexting, calling a woman or hooker and wound up going to meet with her at a hotel at 4 am. He came home at 6 am and told me he did not want to see me and slept on the couch. Yesterday he came home at midnight, told he he wanted space and to leave him be and went to bed.

Well, I snooped on his phone again. Turns out he has been telling his friends and family that I am crazy and irrational and have been driving him crazy with my false accusations of him cheating on me. He says I am paranoid and have driven him to the brink where he is having mental breakdowns. He is telling friends he is thinking of divorcing and he is so miserable with me. He is also communicating with his family saying I am so mean that when he pulls an all nighter to work late, he comes home only to get yelled at by me. Because of this he doesn't want to come home and would rather stay at the office and drown his sorrows in alcohol and music. His friends and family are all sympathetic and are offering him support.

I also saw that he is again texting to meet with another random number. He has downloaded and using multiple hookup apps. :(

I am flabbergasted...Why is he twisting the truth so much? I also understand we have had a very rough year but to blame me for his mental health issues is a bit much. I spent all night crying and am barely holding it together at work.

But she refuses to compromise on things that would or could benefit the marriage.. plain outright says she doesnt want to, and doesnt do it.

,Marriage," 

So I have been having the hardest year of my life with my current husband with whom I have been with for a total of 7 years. We met in our mid twenties and generally had a pretty happy relationship. Things started to go south slowly in mid 2017 with the pressure of getting engaged, planning a wedding and dealing with our difficult and dysfunctional families. In addition we were also starting our careers, living in a HCOL area and generally figuring out adulthood. We are also two very different people who came to blows over many differences and were generally poor with conflict resolution.

We had our lows but would always find a way out and be happy again.

At the start of this year, however, things seem to slowly unravel. My husband suddenly started getting panic attacks this January. Seeing as he was someone who never had anxiety or panic attacks, he was very disturbed by this. He genuinely thought he was dying, and had breakdowns. I took him to the ER, and called the EMTs multiple times at 3 am as he would wake up in a panic saying he was dying. They all cleared him saying he was healthy.

Around March he went to a GP for a checkup who looked at his EKG, read it incorrectly and told him he was dying. Within 30 minutes he called my husband back and said actually he made an error and everything was normal. This seemed to have really spooked my husband to the core. After that for the next few weeks he thought he had heart troubles and would not listen to me as I tried to reason with him.

I finally had him visit a cardiologist who indeed confirmed his heart was fine. We then went back to his GP who said that my husband was suffering from extreme stress and anxiety and needed to be put on medication. She prescribed him 10 mg Lexapro. The Lexapro was a god sent in the sense that it finally erased his panic attacks and shortness of breath. Things seem to finally slowly calm down and go back to normal.

A few weeks on Lexapro I started to notice slight changes in his personality. Suddenly he was colder and more distant. The soft, warm sweetness of his personality was replaced by coldness and anger. Now that his panic attacks and anxiety were gone, suddenly everything else was wrong. He said he hated his job that he previously loved and excelled at. He said he was bored and wanted to quit to join the police academy or start his own business, His family and I cautioned him that he needed to not act suddenly and think things through. Anything we said that wasn't affirmative was met with resistance and anger.

He also started drinking heavily. While my husband has always liked to drink, his daily 2 glasses of wine have now turned into a bottle of wine per night. He also goes out with his friends and gets blasted drunk and parties and bar hops until 2- 3 am in the morning. When I tell him he needs to come home earlier, he gets mean and aggressive and tells me to stop being a fun killer!

Suddenly I am his enemy no.1. He seems to have re-written our entire story where everything about our relationship and marriage is wrong. He hates and resents me for the hurt I have caused him and says he feels trapped and caged. He screams at me, yells at me and has scary episodes. For example, if he comes home at 2 am after bar hopping and I say anything about him staying out too late, he will walk into the kitchen, grab a bottle of wine say he is getting out of here and go lock himself in our car!!

He has also started sexting and chatting and calling with random women from hook up apps. I discovered him receiving nudes from a woman a month ago. When I confronted him about it he screamed at me that he wanted a divorce and ran away to stay with his parents. Another time when I tried to confront him again he screamed at me, took his bottle of wine and locked himself out side in our car. When I tried to go outside and get him to come inside and stalk to me like a normal person, he screamed at me and drove off drunk into the night at 3 am. He did not return home until an hour later.

Recently I discovered that he has been having sex with hookers in hotel rooms. He has recently started not coming home or coming home late after work. He always stays at the office until 3- 4 am and sexts chats and sends nude selfies to random women based on what I have seen on his phone.

If he does come home, he will stay up till 3 am by himself watching a movie and drinking.

Occasionally he will seem to have a moment of clarity, apologize profusely and tell me he doesn't know what he is doing. He gets these extreme rushes of emotions and he cant seem to control himself. The rest of the time when I bring up that something isn't normal he says I am the enemy and he hates me and I need to leave him alone and throws a tantrum and runs away.

I am at my wits end. I do not know what is going on with him. He is an asshole or is he suffering from some mental health issue?

,Marriage,"Been married for two years. Heading for divorce. What do I need to consider about post-divorce life? What are negative outcomes of cheating on a partner? 

My wife and I are both 22 years old. We just “celebrated” our 2 year anniversary a week ago, but we aren’t doing all that well in our relationship. It’s been like this for quite some time, roughly 8-10 months, and we are quickly headed towards divorce if something doesn’t change, and soon. 

A bit of backstory on both of us. I grew up in a very conservative religious household my whole life. My wife on the other hand grew up in a religious household, her dad being a pastor, but was nowhere near as conservative. Prior to marriage, we discussed a middle ground compromise for all of the “standards” and points of difference between us and came to an agreement. 2 years later, it’s time for compromise again and it’s not going too well. 

I’m an introvert, always have been. I’m not socially awkward, I actually carry on a conversation quite well. But I will go unbelievably out of my way to avoid an awkward situation. One of the biggest disagreements we have is how much time I spend with her family. I don’t like being around her family a lot because it’s awkward. Introvert + introvert = sitting around staring at each other not saying much. Her mom especially is socially awkward due to the nature of her introversion, and I don’t get along with her dad very well period. He demands respect, while not giving it out, as far as I see it, and that’s a serious no-go for me. 

Another thing is she wants kids in the not so distant future, I don’t really see myself wanting them within the next 10 years or so. 

I could go on about a list of disagreeable points. We went to marriage counseling twice, before I said I was taking a break from it due to her bringing up something extremely embarrassing during one of our sessions, even though I requested she not mention it prior to us going in. 

Recently we’ve been becoming emotionally numb to anything that has to do with the relationship and not really caring how it ends up. 

Here’s the conundrum. Pretty much my entire social circle is formed of people from my religious group. If I were to divorce, I would seriously be looked down on. Social exclusion, peer pressure, and family emotions are the reasons we haven’t divorced to this point. I know I shouldn’t care about what others think, but in this case try to see things from this perspective; if you divorce, you basically become an outcast. 

Recently I started talking to this girl at a location that I frequent, and becoming friends with her has been refreshing. Talking to her gives me something to look forward to every morning instead of being in a seemingly constant state of sadness. I want to get to know her better, not in a relationship sense, but just as a friend. Only problem is, if anybody found out about it, including my wife, or anyone else in the social circle, (a lot of them live in the same city as I do, therefore frequent the same places I do) it would be considered cheating even though I’m not doing anything outrageous like sleeping with her or anything remotely close to that, and then we’re back to the outcast scenario.

If I continue to talk to this girl, I could either tell her I’m married up front, wait a while until it comes up, or not tell her at all. However, I’m afraid when and if she finds out I’m married, she won’t want to talk to me anymore.

Heading for divorce. What do I need to consider about post-divorce life? What are negative outcomes of cheating on a partner? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I are both 22 years old. We just “celebrated” our 2 year anniversary a week ago, but we aren’t doing all that well in our relationship. It’s been like this for quite some time, roughly 8-10 months, and we are quickly headed towards divorce if something doesn’t change, and soon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of backstory on both of us. I grew up in a very conservative religious household my whole life. My wife on the other hand grew up in a religious household, her dad being a pastor, but was nowhere near as conservative. Prior to marriage, we discussed a middle ground compromise for all of the “standards” and points of difference between us and came to an agreement. 2 years later, it’s time for compromise again and it’s not going too well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m an introvert, always have been. I’m not socially awkward, I actually carry on a conversation quite well. But I will go unbelievably out of my way to avoid an awkward situation. One of the biggest disagreements we have is how much time I spend with her family. I don’t like being around her family a lot because it’s awkward. Introvert + introvert = sitting around staring at each other not saying much. Her mom especially is socially awkward due to the nature of her introversion, and I don’t get along with her dad very well period. He demands respect, while not giving it out, as far as I see it, and that’s a serious no-go for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is she wants kids in the not so distant future, I don’t really see myself wanting them within the next 10 years or so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on about a list of disagreeable points. We went to marriage counseling twice, before I said I was taking a break from it due to her bringing up something extremely embarrassing during one of our sessions, even though I requested she not mention it prior to us going in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently we’ve been becoming emotionally numb to anything that has to do with the relationship and not really caring how it ends up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the conundrum. Pretty much my entire social circle is formed of people from my religious group. If I were to divorce, I would seriously be looked down on. Social exclusion, peer pressure, and family emotions are the reasons we haven’t divorced to this point. I know I shouldn’t care about what others think, but in this case try to see things from this perspective; if you divorce, you basically become an outcast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I started talking to this girl at a location that I frequent, and becoming friends with her has been refreshing. Talking to her gives me something to look forward to every morning instead of being in a seemingly constant state of sadness. I want to get to know her better, not in a relationship sense, but just as a friend. Only problem is, if anybody found out about it, including my wife, or anyone else in the social circle, (a lot of them live in the same city as I do, therefore frequent the same places I do) it would be considered cheating even though I’m not doing anything outrageous like sleeping with her or anything remotely close to that, and then we’re back to the outcast scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I continue to talk to this girl, I could either tell her I’m married up front, wait a while until it comes up, or not tell her at all. However, I’m afraid when and if she finds out I’m married, she won’t want to talk to me anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not here for sympathy, but please be respectful of the situation. I want constructive criticism and/or advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to cheat on my wife, but I also don’t want to divorce her. What are some things that maybe I’m not thinking of that could impact long term, or some perspectives I should look at that I may be too narrow sighted to see in my current state?&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"I feel so much regret and personal responsibility about the current horrible state of my marriage. I found out recently that my husband of 5 years is cheating on me with multiple women and you know, as angry as I am at him, I am mostly very sad and disappointed at myself. In hindsight, I realize the points where I could have and should have done better and stepped up to the plate to be the wife he wanted and needed me to be. Instead, I was selfish, cruel and unkind. 

He was willing to, and gave me, his all. And all I did was mercilessly put him down and pushed him away.

I can't stop thinking about the things I did wrong:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Respect. He asked me repeatedly to respect him more. I was an uppity prissy princess and could not appreciate his gentle, grounded salt-of-the-earth nature. I wanted to change him, update him, make him more hip or cool. I wanted him to dress different, get a different job, make new friends.

I stubbornly held the stance that what I wanted him to be or do was the best and most perfect way.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I made everything an issue. Every little flaw or imperfection he had or did, I tore apart with gutso. I just could not let things slide and did not know how to pick my battles. As a result everything became a battle and my poor husband felt like he couldn't win.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Tone of voice. I would become very rude and go nuclear anytime we had a disagreement. I had to win and would throw around ""divorce"" as if it was confetti. He told me he could not handle my anger and shut down but I kept pushing and pushing

&amp;#x200B;

\- Got caught up in the ""timeline"" of life. I had a 5 year plan. I wanted to date, get engaged and get married on a certain timeline. I was always upset and dissatisfied with all his efforts because we hadn't ""made it yet."" Life felt like an endless competition for him and he could never measure up to the perfect life I had in my head.

,Marriage,"Please forgive me. English is not my 1st language. I am a Filipino. Tldr at the end. Anyways,

My husband (27M) and I (29F) have just been married (9months) but we are experiencing a rocky relationship right now. We got married when I was 6 months pregnant. I have a love child (9F)

Eversince we got married I noticed how my husband despises my mom. He hates him with all his might. Maybe because my mom became really broke. But she was kinda rich before. This is my 1st issue with him. He treats my mom with disgust, and doesn't even talk to her. (my mom is super sweet, and she even washes my husband's clothes and underwear. Oh, and I am an only child so she is really longing for a son) by the way, my husband doesn't share bills with us. He just pays for the internet bill. But won't share for food specially when my mom is around. 

After I gave birth, he decided that we should leave our home (my house where we lived with my first daughter and my mom. My dad died already, my mom doesn't have any family) he wanted us to move to his grandparents' house because he doesn't like to have an in-law around. So I had to leave my mom and my 9-year-old kid behind, since school just started. My 2nd issue was, he let his dad live with us and his mom was also there 5 days a week. They put up their own business (with my husband) and I don't know nothing about it. He is a mama's boy, and he tells his mom about any financial matter. This hurts me a lot.

My 3rd issue with him is, he doesn't tell me about his financial status. I mean, yeah sure, he feeds me. But other than that, he doesn't tell me shit. Like, how much he's earning, when is his pay day, his ATM password. Sometimes he even hides his wallet. So even if I was 8 months pregnant before, he asked me to find a job because he told me he couldn't support me enough. And now, after I gave birth, I need to find a job immediately to support my own needs and for my 1st child which I think he hates, because he doesn't even talk to her.

It was my birthday last week, and the day before my birthday we had a huge fight and we got violent with each other so I decided to go home in my original house. He didn't even greet me on my friggin birthday. A week after my birthday, he visited our baby but he didn't say a word to me. We didn't talk. 

My heart is aching right now, I think I am not growing with him anymore. I think I need to leave him? Please enlighten me. What should I do? I am so torn.

,Marriage,"My husband isn't a terribly chatty guy, never has been. For example, it's pretty normal for him to come home after work and not say anything to me, no hi, how was your day, things like that. I don't particularly like it but I've not been able to change it.

Sometimes I'll ask him how his day was or simply say hello to him when he gets home, rather than be angry because he didn't, only to get a monotone one or two word reply.

Other times if I try talking to him, or ask him a question, or perhaps we're working around the house together and I try to have a general conversation about anything, the typical response is short and *sounds* short. That's the thing that bothers me the most - more often than not his response(s) to me sounds like he's mildly annoyed or he simply doesn't want to be bothered making the tiny bit of effort required to speak back to me.

It's the tone that he uses with me. It's not *obviously* an annoyed/impatient tone, but it's certainly not warm or ""friendly"".

,Marriage,"I'm f(28) my husband is a decade older, (38) and we have been together since I was 18. 

From the beginning when we first started our relationship I was always a hungry go getter. At my tender 18 years I already had my own place and a very steady good income. I had an abusive childhood so my early teen years I spent saving for the day I turned 18 and I could finally leave it all behind and I was so proud that I did. 

Our first years where the most exciting but troubling, it's TRUE what they say, you don't really know a person until you live with them. I always knew he was a settler, and by that I mean when we met he didn't have a job, he lived with his parents and had already dropped school. You would think an older man would have his things together, but my husband, my baby bird as I like to call him was broken. But his LOVE patience and nurture helped me through my most darkest hours. I can tell you I suffered so but because I went undiagnosed with a disease for so long, so my quality of life wasn't great. But his patience and love made me hang in there and fight for us. 

You probably think what's the problem right? 

Well it's been 10 years, 10 years of nurturing this relationship and providing for my husband that is killing me. 

I have found lately with some lifestyle changes and losses that I'm not the same 18 year old anymore. I want a partner, I want a home, I want children, I want to build a life that provides stability and comfort. 

In these 10 years I've accumulated so much debt, mostly because my husband can't keep a stable job, or look to find something more that pays minimum wage. 

When I was sick, when I've had surgeries, when I've laid in bed wanting it all to end, I would have loved his support, I would have loved him to step up and take control so I could heal and take time for myself. But I'm afraid this dream or needs I have now will never be met. 

I don't have trouble talking, I've told him I need a partner, countless of times, I've asked for help around the house, sometimes I work 70 plus hours but I still have to come home, pick up, make dinner etc. 

Lately anything he does annoys me enough to cause me to distance myself, its like all of a sudden this veil that I had that blocked all his bad habits came down, and the person I see is not one I would call a "" partner"" 

I think I've given so much for so long I'm all out of giving. And I'm on empty. 

This year was full of challenges, he lost his job again due to drug use, he got a random and it was enough to have him let go. With this we lost a steady income, fell more indebted, his vehicle got repo, and along with it my credit scores tanked since I was the co-signer. Our debt got so bad, I had to discontinue my medical treatment, and we are now getting ready to file bankruptcy. Yay me! 

Isn't a marriage supposed to be about partnership? What if I have expressed my needs repeatedly, given deadlines and expectations but nothing changes? Is it over? 

Am I a bitch for letting money be such a big deal at this phase in our lives?

,Marriage,"My wife is 3 months pregnant and going through a bit of a rough time. Currently she does not have much motivation to do much other than stay home and on top of that the pregnancy is draining her energy pretty drastically. Also, she has been struggling with anxiety for a while. Good news is that we are working on it and will soon go to a therapist. But for now, I would like to do something for her just to get her out of this cycle.

We live in North San Diego County and would be willing to drive 30-45 minutes in any direction but would prefer to stay close.

She likes:

Music (raggae is one of her favorites)

Hanging out w/ friends (bbqs, at peoples home...nothing too crazy or packed w/people)

The beach

She loves her 2 little dogs and it would be great to bring them along

Good food! (Shes Italian)

She also likes shopping (not the best pastime but we will be needing baby stuff)

Anything helps just want to make that woman smile for a whole day! And then over and over again!!

She decided she wanted to try an online school, but was unable to focus her attention because of her condition and we withdrew her from classes. She doesn’t want to pursue disability because she will feel helpless. She recently got a part time job in retail, but quit because she hated it and that anxiety was fueling her physical condition. 

I want to be a good husband. I have sat with her in the hospital and taken off work as much as possible to be there to take care of her. Please believe me when I say I am not a money hungry person, but I will soon be in the slow season at work and probably not getting full time hours. I am also unable to get a second job because my work involves emergency response and on call shifts. I can currently cover all the bills, but I’m not sure about a couple of months from now. We moved in with her mom, so there’s no rent. However, there are still other bills (like student loans) to be paid. Should I push the disability knowing it will hurt her emotionally? Do I push her to get a job knowing it will hurt hr physically? Or would pushing her be better because it might build confidence she lost with her medical condition? Ideally I would love for her to not have to work, but realistically there are bills to be paid.

,Marriage,"We moved to a new city about a year and a half ago. It's two and half hours from where we used to live. The car I had was a POS and couldn't make it to our new place so I've been borrowing my in-laws 2001 truck during that time. We weren't able to get me a new car because we were trying to pay for the wedding and other life things. Last week, the truck finally bit the dust and was going to cost $900 to fix.

,Marriage,"Hi all... I feel like an ass for writing this as I sit here with my 4 week old newborn, but here goes. 

My husband and I have been married all of 4 months, and for the most part we get along totally great. He has aspergers, which has caused some communication issues in the past, but we’ve done counseling and came out stronger (or so I thought). 

Last year, we moved in together and I was devastated to find out he had been hiding a coke habit from me. This was a very upsetting revelation, but after 5 months of counseling, I had learned to trust him again. He stopped coke, really made an effort to communicate, and seemed to prioritize our relationship. The coke thing obviously put a strain on my trust for him, but we worked through it consistently and I thought things were great!

So some background on his ex. When we first met he had been single for 3 years. In that time he had started a successful business and was casually dating but not having luck finding anyone. He also mentioned that he took a long time to get over his ex, and the break was needed. He had said that it was hard on him but they both agreed they’d be better friends than lovers and so have been in touch ever since. I have zero issues with remaining friends with an ex if there’s no residual feelings. 

One thing that stuck out to me when he first described her is that he said “I love her more than anyone; I’d do anything for her”. At the time, I thought it was extreme, but as I got to know him I realized he throws the love word around a lot with all kinds of people, so it didn’t register as a big red flag. 

Fast forward to now: we’re married and new baby. Stress is high. I mentioned to him recently that I would like more one on one time with him and asked for a date night. He agreed and then promptly forgot day of. This hurt, but nothing I could t get over. I mentioned to him that it hurt my feelings and that I didn’t feel important to him. He counters it with “you know I love you more than anyone, and I’d do anything for you”. I could t help but think of what he said about the ex. So I mentioned that: I hear you, but it’s really hard for me to feel secure in that when that’s the exact same thing you said about your ex when we first met. 

He exclaimed, “that’s absurd—I haven’t seen her for 4 months! That’s not at all the same. I married you and had a baby with you”. 

My response, “when did you see your ex?” (I’ve yet to meet her, btw, though he said twice he’d like me to) 

His response “what?”

I knew I caught him in a lie or at least an exclusion of the truth. Then he went on to explain he saw her in the street. I didn’t believe him, told him that and went to bed. 

Next morning I’m downstairs having coffee and feeding the baby and he comes down and asks “what exactly are you so upset about?”  

I told him that I didn’t like that he didn’t tell me about hanging out with his ex. He replied that he couldn’t tell me because I “forbid” him from having a friendship with her. This is simply not true. I know they text and we just invited her to our housewarming party in 12 days! This is where I would supposedly meet her. 

I told him this and said “do you expect me to believe that you ran into your ex on the street conveniently around her birthday?” He corrected  me and said that her birthday was in March. And that he hadn’t had plans to hang out with her since February, and that he did see her casually a few months ago. I asked when he saw her in February and why he didn’t tell me. Apparently they had drinks after work. 

This is where I flipped out and called him a liar. I asked where he told me he had gone that night and he was silent. He never mentioned this to me and he always always texts me his whereabouts—unprompted by me. I had no reason to think there was anything shady going on, but now I find out he’s hidden at least one meetup with his ex. I hate to think what else he’s hidden. 

Now, with the coke thing passed and this in front view, I feel done.

,Marriage,"My SO and I have been together for 6 years. Things have been going fairly well until recently. You see we’ve been struggling financially as of late, mostly due to the fact that his current place of employment isn’t as busy as it had been in recent months and as a result he’s gotten less hours. 

He and I both work (full time) but with him working less, it’s caused friction. My salary isn’t enough to help fill the gap, and we’ve used whatever savings we’ve had towards fixing our cars, or towards home repair. 

He keeps complaining about not having enough money, and every time he complains I suggest maybe he look into getting a part time job to help. As soon as the words leave my mouth, he starts going on a rant of all the reasons why that isn’t a option.  

I’m trying to be understanding, because I know he likes his current job, but the financial stress is taking its toll on our relationship.

Edit:: thank you everyone for your advice, I hadn’t considered speaking with a financial advisor and I’ll be seeking some info from one as soon as we can.

To answer a few of the questions I’ve received I’ll list them below.

- I’d say I my weekly take home is on par or slightly less than my SO’s, when it’s his busy season.
- he’s been working at his current job for about a year and a half and we are well aware that it does have its slow periods, but the main difference is that last year he had a side hustle that earned him extra cash. This year he isn’t doing that any longer, hence the added strain we are feeling.
- we’ve already cut down on things such a as dining out/ take out, date nights, and cable (we’re more of a Netflix couple). But as for downsizing , we both have jobs that require us to travel so getting rid of one of our cars isn’t an option at the moment.

Things have been going fairly well until recently. You see we’ve been struggling financially as of late, mostly due to the fact that his current place of employment isn’t as busy as it had been in recent months and as a result he’s gotten less hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and I both work (full time) but with him working less, it’s caused friction. My salary isn’t enough to help fill the gap, and we’ve used whatever savings we’ve had towards fixing our cars, or towards home repair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He keeps complaining about not having enough money, and every time he complains I suggest maybe he look into getting a part time job to help. As soon as the words leave my mouth, he starts going on a rant of all the reasons why that isn’t a option.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to be understanding, because I know he likes his current job, but the financial stress is taking its toll on our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:: thank you everyone for your advice, I hadn’t considered speaking with a financial advisor and I’ll be seeking some info from one as soon as we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer a few of the questions I’ve received I’ll list them below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’d say I my weekly take home is on par or slightly less than my SO’s, when it’s his busy season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he’s been working at his current job for about a year and a half and we are well aware that it does have its slow periods, but the main difference is that last year he had a side hustle that earned him extra cash. This year he isn’t doing that any longer, hence the added strain we are feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we’ve already cut down on things such a as dining out/ take out, date nights, and cable (we’re more of a Netflix couple). But as for downsizing , we both have jobs that require us to travel so getting rid of one of our cars isn’t an option at the moment. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yes, I am looking for a new position that can offer better pay, until then I’m doing side jobs to earn extra money on my days off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; giving him an ultimatum isn’t an option. Yes I am concerned about our finances, but threatening separation isn’t going to ease any anxieties.&lt;/li&gt;

,Marriage,"

I don’t know how we got here exactly or when it all started to happen... all I know is my heart feels broken.

We had a beautiful wedding this past June. 

I knew from the get-go there is not such thing as a happily ever after, because every marriage has its issues. But I never, ever imagined I would experience these types of problems this soon. 

He’s always had an issue with pornography, which made me uncomfortable - especially when he would always ask for it in the background during our intimacy. I dealt with it, and at the same time i didn’t because i would constantly ask for him not to, a request that would often times upset him, I’m not going to explain all the issues we’ve experienced because frankly, this would be a novella. 

Fast forward to our one month mark, and he starts insisting having someone else in the room with us during sex. He pushed and pushed, and eventually I gave in. He sought out a tinder account and started looking for someone. After a couple failed attempts, and maybe out of the mercy of seeing how bad it made me feel, he deleted it. Weeks later and he starts telling me he wants multiple wives. Yes, multiple wives. You can imagine how heart shattering it was to hear that, so I’m not going to detail the pain I experienced. I shot down the idea, obviously. We’re not Mormon or of any denomination that normalizes this. And this would have been the first time I even heard that from him. It was a days and days of arguing and crying and saying no. Then, one day his phone starts going off. As a curious cat, I tried grabbing it and he panicked. I grabbed the phone after many minutes of struggling and I realized he was texting a girl. From school. It was probably only a couple of exchanged messages but he was flirting with her. I had so many emotions building up, I felt like I was loosing my mind. He said that he still wanted another wife, and that that desire hadn’t changed. I explained to him, as I had many times already, that it would never happen with me in the picture. 

Long days after, and a couple half assed apologizes because, according to him, he’d done no harm. 

Last night I found some pictures he took of a classmate’s butt. Dressed and all, and without her knowing, had taken several shots during class. I once again dug my own grave looking through his phone.... I really should stop doing that. 

TLDR; married three months. He wants more wives. Heartbroken me has said no many times and has had to deal with a situations in which he tries to start down that path. 

I’m so lost, confused, and simply devastated this is happening. I love him, and in an odd way I know he loves me too. How do I save us? Would “ignorance is bliss” be the key? What about the resentments that surface out of nowhere when we’re having a good time with each other?",t2_4ka1olbz,False,,0,False,Three months in...,[],r/Marriage,False,6,,0,,False,t3_d2jebv,False,dark,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,self,1568171449.0,,[],[],{},,True,,1568198932.0,text,6,,text,self.Marriage,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how we got here exactly or when it all started to happen... all I know is my heart feels broken.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"My wife and I will be celebrating our one year anniversary in 2 weeks, but the last three months have been awful. Back in july she started telling me all the things that she did not like about me.  She mentioned that she thinks we got married to soon (we dated for over 5 years before our wedding) and even stated that she no longer wanted to have children with me. She requested that I move out of our house and live on my own to work on myself. This is all very shocking to me because we had a pretty stable relationship before all of this happened. No huge arguments, no infidelity and we are generally best friends who do everything together. 

We have been going to couples counceling but are not getting anywhere. She just continuously tells me that I am messed up. 

I suffer from anxiety.  I have been dealing with it very well for years, but I do occasionally have a panic attack here or there. I also have a very big personality, so she hates how I tend to take over rooms. Her biggest issue is that I am very direct with conversations.

,Marriage,"My wife and I have been married for 8 years. The first 1-2 years were great, but since then there has been a noticeable decline in interest and affection from me.

When I met my wife she was on top of the world. She ran 10 miles almost every day so she was very fit (5'6"", 130 lbs). She worked full time and was a full-time college student getting straight A's. She had goals and ambitions, her own life. I was immediately attracted to her physically and personality. I've never wanted to be with someone that would be a burden, someone I would have to take care of constantly.

We got married 6 months later. I had to move out of state for my Job and she came with me. She dropped everything to be with me. As a result she became depressed - sad all day until I came home from work, didn't do anything, tried to get a few jobs but couldn't ever hold them down and got fired three times. She started spending money and charging things to credit. This has continued on and off ever since then.

Now, she is almost 300 lbs, still has never held down a job, tried going back to school once and dropped out two weeks in. We have two kids, age 6 and 4. Our 4 year old is Autistic and she uses him as a reason why she doesn't work. She says she doesn't have enough availability to get a job (he's in school from 7:30 am to 3:00 pm every weekday). She has to take Xanax because she has a panic attack almost every night.

Her daily routine is to get kids on the bus, goes back to sleep, get kids off the bus, give them iPads/Nintendo Switch until dinner (usually instant mac and cheese or frozen pizza), put them to bed, and then stay up late binge eating until she goes to sleep, which is very expensive (fast food and delivery) and we have accumulated over $20,000 of debt from her impulse purchases over the years.

She's been seeing therapists and doctors for depression and binge eating for the last 5 years. Nothing has worked. She refuses to be on anti-depressants because she doesn't like the way they make her feel. She takes medication for her thyroid, which she blames the weight gain on. She says she cant control her weight because of her thyroid.

I've tried being supportive and understanding, I've empowered her to find jobs, go back to school, go to the gym, but none of it works. She might get motivated for a few days, but then its back to the same depressed routine.

At this point my relationship has become the thing I feared the most. I feel like my life is being ruined by my marriage. Before I got married I was very successful. I saved money easily, never had any debt or financial issues. I was never stressed out about life in general. I've completely lost any romantic feeling, it's all just resentment. I dont want to talk to her, touch her, or even be in the same room as her. Any time we kiss, hold each other, or have sex it's because I'm doing it just to get her off my back about never doing anything, it's like a routine that's just enough to keep her from complaining about it. She started snoring lately so I can't even sleep. There's no physical attraction because of her weight, and any emotional attachment is gone because I blame her for the financial stress and every night I am stressed because she is always depressed or anxious about something.

I've been considering Divorce for a long time, but I never do it because I don't know how she would possibly take care of herself and our kids without me around, I have so much debt I don't know how I could possibly pay child support and alimony and have any money left, and because I secretly hope that one day she'll snap out of it and be the person I married again, but that doesn't seem likely. I don't want my kids raised without me, I'm the one that actually teaches them personal responsibility, but I can't live in this relationship for much longer. I haven't felt happy or optimistic about my life in years.

Has anyone experienced something like this? Were you able to save it? I just need to know if I should keep holding out hope, or just face reality and admit it's never going to be the same again.

I wake up at 5am to leave for work and am some times am gone for a few days... now my daughter is finally in Pre-K and we have said for the last 4 years that when my daughter goes to school that my wife would get a job... except every day it’s a struggle for my wife to wake up to get her to school on time, every day her alarm goes off 2-3 times and I have to end up asking her to get up so my daughter won’t be late to school... my wife is supposed to be working on her resume but she spends maybe an hour at most on it then gets on her phone to play games... I have busted my butt for 4 years trying to make sure we have a roof over our head and all I ask is that she at least work on her resume... am I asking too much? I told her I don’t want her to just take any shitty job, I want her to find one that makes her happy, but I also want her to actually start looking... it’s been over a month since my daughter started school and my wife is barely 1/4 of the way done with her resume... she spends more time playing her cell phone games than on her resume and I’m starting to feel like she takes me for granted... I work very hard, I pay all the bills, I make sure we have food, I do the cleaning, I help with everything and take care of the household stuff after I get home from work... This morning I about lost it, after working 2 - 15 hour days in a row, driving from SC back to Florida and come home to my wife playing her cell phone game again... so this morning the alarm goes off for the 3rd time and I ask her can she please get up so I don’t have to hear her alarm over and over... when I wake up at 5am I make sure I don’t disturb her or wake her... she starts getting mad and I say “you have one thing to take care of every morning, you said you wanted to do it, this was your thing to do and you can’t even wake up on time again” (this has been going on for a month straight) She gets mad and throws a water bottle at me and just loses it... at this point I love her but I’m so tired of doing this alone... she doesn’t have to parent alone cause I’m there and when I’m gone for a few days cause of work, she still has my dad who is willing to help and my mom around to drop off the kid with... instead she just gets mad... not sure what to do anymore... I’m tired of being the only one who makes sure our bills are paid and after 4 years of struggling, when we finally have a chance to get ahead, she spends more time playing cell phone games and avoiding it... any advice from someone who has had a similar experience? I don’t want to leave her but I’m running out of options... when she gets mad she doesn’t walk away... she yells at me in front of our daughter, she throws stuff and then when I walk out the door her first thing is to pack my daughters stuff and act like she is gonna take her away...

EDIT: she doesn’t play on her phone all day and not do anything around the house, I worded that wrong... it’s more just whenever she has a chance, like when our daughter naps, or I’m playing with our daughter, or she is sitting down, going to the bathroom, smoking a cigarette, time when I wish we would have a conversation... she avoids the resume at all costs and spends all her free time on her phone... she does help around the house and spends lots of time with our daughter, she is a great mom and I won’t take that from her but she also doesn’t do any of it alone...

,Marriage,"This is really just to vent, but I'm starting to hate the sound of my wife's voice. I am starting to avoid her on purpose because she will start to complain at me or ask me to do something because she doesn't want to do it. 

It's worse when I'm driving. I'll be slowing down when there's a red light and she'll panic and say red light! She'll tell me to get in the right lane on the way home which annoys me because I've lived there for four years. 
The part that pisses me off the most is I can't make a concerned noise when she makes a sharp turn or leans to far to the right or to the left. If I were to speak to her the way she speaks to me, she is so fast to snap back at me. I have to sit there and take it, if I try to defend myself she always resorts to ""well it's a safety thing""
Even worse is that her family will make all sorts of minor mistakes which isn't weird, but she doesn't say a fucking thing. What's funny is that if she did her family members would snap right back.

The part that pisses me off the most is I can&amp;#39;t make a concerned noise when she makes a sharp turn or leans to far to the right or to the left.

I have to sit there and take it, if I try to defend myself she always resorts to &amp;quot;well it&amp;#39;s a safety thing&amp;quot;
Even worse is that her family will make all sorts of minor mistakes which isn&amp;#39;t weird, but she doesn&amp;#39;t say a fucking thing. What&amp;#39;s funny is that if she did her family members would snap right back.

When I pointed out that the last two times we bought ONE gallon of milk, it went bad before we could finish it.

He thought for a moment and said, ""You know, I went through a lot more milk before we got married. I would go through one and a half or even two gallons in a week.""

I reminded him that as a bachelor, it was not uncommon for him to eat cereal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

,Marriage,"My wife is almost 5 months pregnant and is threatening all the above. She kicked me out of the house and for 3 days only sends extremely intense messages to me, refuses to see or allow me to initiate contact.
I have shared all with my therapist, and he has said my responses are all good - regretful, supportive, loving - it is just when or if she will calm down.

This fight was my fault. I came home late and drunk, after I said it wouldn't happen again. I was literally just across the street for 2 hrs longer than I said I would be. And me thinking it was not a big deal was one of her triggers. 100% my mistake I know. This used to happen a lot, but it hasn't happened once since we found out she was pregnant. But I did this and she says I abandoned her and the baby, I know she is waking up in the middle of the night and I need to be there for them always. And she is right. She knows I love them, and she does love me very much, but when she gets like this it takes days for her rage to subside, and then sadness, and then remorse for her actions.  But I am scared because she feels that due to her term she needs to make a decision in the next few days before it is too late. She doesn't want to do it, but she can't be a single mom, and she doesn't want to be with me, so she thinks there may be no other way, only adoption.

We have been through some rough times before of course, some warranted by my behavior, but all of her reactions are extreme and usually overreactions. But it usually subsides after a few days. But these last 3 months have been wonderful, lots of supportive loving experiences. But I made this mistake and all feels lost.

We have had very serious fights in the past. At the beginning it was frequent, over these 7/8 years it has become less and less. But she gets extremely angry, never to the point of violence but one step away. The last few times, breaking things, screaming and destroying items she/we love, while I try to calm her down, which just angers her more. She has seen a therapist in the past because of her anger but not for a long time. She decided since I was the trigger, I should see someone, which I do.

She is a very proud person,  so any act that feels disrespectful can cause this. She is very stressed with work, I know that her hormones are going crazy, and she feels very alone, that I am all she has. And I let her down, which she never thought I would do while she was pregnant.  I am so ashamed of my actions, but I know our love is stronger than this, that if she allows it that we can work through this. My therapist isn't sure that maybe we should, he feels I don't deserve all of this, that I have changed a lot over the years, that I work hard to be a good partner, a good person. 

Now I am receiving hundreds of texts a day. Very hurtful, cruel and scary texts. I am the one killing the baby, my dead father would be disgusted with me, I don't deserve to have children, and worse.  She messages me she hates me, while I do know she tells her friend that she loves me. I talked with her OBG to help to convince her from going through with any procedure. My main concern now is the baby's well being, and her health, mentally and physically. Once I know the baby is safe, then I can focus on us.

I am just so scared. I've waited my whole life to be a father, now I don't know what to do, and I am scared that even if she decides not to go through with any horrible procedure, that we have done harm to our baby from this experience, and that she won't allow us to work on our marriage, get through this, get back to the happy place where were just in.

We are also in her foreign country, so I have no good friends or family close to talk to. I am too embarrassed to reach out to anyone anyways. Most of my family and friends know about her temper and her extreme reactions, but this I do not want to share.

Now I am sleeping a couple hours here and there, barely eating, and I know she is the same. I am moving from airbnbs until she let's me come home, if ever. I don't want to interact with anyone else, so I am working from home, but cannot do that indefinitely, will need to go back to the office. I just am too much of a wreck, just pacing and checking for new messages constantly. I don't want to read them, my stomach drops when my phone buzzes, but I need to be vigilant for her and the baby, even is she hates me.

I am just so scared, in so much pain, literally moaning at night, thinking about the baby.

,Marriage,"My spouse and I have been married for 10 months. We’ve been together for almost 5 years.

We’ve had a lot of ups and downs but we always got through them, until 2 months ago. I got upset over something and confronted them about it, I’m not the best communicator and can let my emotions get the better of me. They left the next day.

We then agreed it would be best to live a part for a while and then try to work things out while we were living apart but they kept saying they weren’t ready to see me. They said I am emotionally abusive and that I take my depression out on them and I need to make some serious and long term changes before they would consider working things out. So for the last month i accepted that I was emotionally abusive and I committed to making changes, I go to therapy, I write a journal, I do meditation, I’m on the waiting list for a cognitive behavioural therapist, I’m on the waiting list for a therapist who specialises in domestic abuse. 

So I told my spouse that. They told me they wanted to take 6 months and have both of us work on ourselves. In that time they wanted to explore dating other people. We came up with a set of rules, no committed relationships with other people, just casual dating etc
My spouse was abused as a child and sexually assaulted as an adult and has a lot of issues with their body and sexual intimacy. They said as part of their journey towards healing themselves, they wanted to explore that part as well and learn how to love themselves in all aspects. I respect this.

,Marriage,"I was in a severely abusive relationship before I met my current fiancé. When we first met I was in therapy and taking medication for PTSD, and severe POCD that resulted from the bad relationship. 

In the beginning of our relationship I would have really bad nightmares, wake up feeling like I was going to throw up, and my fiancé would hold me and calm me. He still does this for me 4 years later- even though the nightmares only happen rarely now. 

Our wedding is less than three weeks away, and this month is also the anniversary of when I met my abusive ex- so a lot of feelings and anxiety come up around this time of the year. I’m kicking myself for not making our wedding date during a month where there isn’t any negative connotations!! But anywho- lately I’ve been having severe anxiety and depression. The wedding is stressing me out, the planning, the arguments between me and my fiancé about trivial crap- decorations, parents rooms in hotel, vodka brands, etc. whenever I get in an argument or fight with someone it triggers my PTSD really badly. So the arguing has made me feel so many bad feelings from my past. Finally today I poured my feelings out to my fiancé about how I’m struggling with PTSD and that arguing triggers my anxiety and the memories of the abuse, and he was really helpful and supportive.

When we first met I was in therapy and taking medication for PTSD, and severe POCD that resulted from the bad relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of our relationship I would have really bad nightmares, wake up feeling like I was going to throw up, and my fiancé would hold me and calm me. He still does this for me 4 years later- even though the nightmares only happen rarely now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our wedding is less than three weeks away, and this month is also the anniversary of when I met my abusive ex- so a lot of feelings and anxiety come up around this time of the year. I’m kicking myself for not making our wedding date during a month where there isn’t any negative connotations!! But anywho- lately I’ve been having severe anxiety and depression. The wedding is stressing me out, the planning, the arguments between me and my fiancé about trivial crap- decorations, parents rooms in hotel, vodka brands, etc. whenever I get in an argument or fight with someone it triggers my PTSD really badly. So the arguing has made me feel so many bad feelings from my past. Finally today I poured my feelings out to my fiancé about how I’m struggling with PTSD and that arguing triggers my anxiety and the memories of the abuse, and he was really helpful and supportive. He held me and told me he would always be here for me and make sure that I’m always safe. He told me I am safe now and that I never have to feel like I felt them ever again. I’m so blessed to have found my love, he truly makes me feel at ease even when my chest feels like I’m crushing under the weight of a car. Im so glad that I am marrying him :)&lt;/p&gt;

In her previous marriage, she says her daughter used to have seizures and her husband wanted nothing to do with the child.  One day, her daughter had a seizure in her bedroom and died in the middle of the night.  Her ex leaves her right after that.

 After a few years, her and I got it off and we got married. She immediately wanted to have kids which I was okay with.  We have a daughter and a son, both are okay (my son is a bit autistic).  Anyway, my wife insisted that we have the kids sleep in our bed.

,Marriage,"We’ve been married for 10 years, but the last couple we’ve been struggling. About a month ago my wife proposed a kind of fresh start reconciliation, where we both put aside our differences and focus on loving each other for the good of two children (5 &amp; 7 yo). I was surprised but very happy to accept and I thought things were Ok. 

Yesterday my wife got fed up with my behavior and got very angry with me and told me it was over, that she had proposed the reconciliation to see if I really wanted to work things out but now she was sure I didn’t and that she had no doubts about ending our relationship. 

I’m not sure exactly what I did yesterday to set her off; I think she didn’t like the way in which I was hanging out with the kids that morning (she was sleeping). After I came back from the park with my daughter, she was in the basement and became upset that I had washed our bath towels and the kids clothes together in the same load. I said I was sorry i didn’t realize that was bad, but she just lost it and said that was it for us. She went upstairs and threw everything off the kitchen table and then went upstairs to our room. 

I went up there to talk to her and she got so angry again she threw all the things off her bed side table. She also called me asshole, loudly when I was out of sight, so the kids definitely heard her. It’s not the first time she’s called me and asshole, prick, etc in front of the kids. I’ve never called her anything like that, even in private. 

Are children could hear all this and hear her and they were crying and upset. My son tried to console her and I heard her telling him that she was feeling this way because daddy was mean to mommy and that people don’t have to stay together when they’re mean to each other. 

Earlier in the day I had made a dinner reservation for us and some friends for that night. After this fighting and before dinner she was saying to me “i don’t want you to go to dinner because i can’t stand you”, “I don’t want you to go so I can tell everyone we’re separated and then we can’t go back.” And then she told me our friends really thought there was “something fundamentally wrong with me,” as she presumably has been talking to her friend about us. Then right before dinner she asks me so are you coming to dinner?! 

In the end I did go to dinner... my therapist tells me she’s gaslighting me and I need to be setting boundaries. I’m worried about these fighting episodes in front of the kids, and really that’s my red line, but I’m just scared of leaving her and the relationship. Scared for whether it’s better for the kids or the right thing to do. I love her and our family. She thinks I don’t love her and I think that’s where her anger and unhappiness comes from. I try and show her but it’s like whatever I’m doing is not reaching her.  I feel guilty and responsible that she’s feeling so angry and unhappy but I don’t know what to do.

,Marriage,"What are your thoughts? Do you agree with this?

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, my wife and I had the following conversation. I left it feeling insulted. She had no idea she had spoken insultingly.

Actual Statement

Wife: I don’t mean to ask you for stuff first thing in the morning. But I need you to talk to our daughter about doing her chores. She’s supposed to clean out her backpack on Fridays. She didn’t do it. She never does it.  I cleaned out her backpack. It was such a big mess. Could you talk to her? I’m so tired. I’m the only one pushing the ball downfield.

&amp;#x200B;

HUSBAND’S UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONVERSATION

What is means when translated into the Male Language.

*I don’t mean to ask you for stuff first thing in the morning. But I need*

Male’s thoughts: I’m just waking up. “Holy cow. I’ve been awake 5 minutes. What are we even talking about?”

*I need you to talk to our daughter about doing her chores*

&amp;#x200B;

Translation: This is imperative.

Male’s thoughts: “I need to pay attention or I’m going to get in trouble. But I can’t get my mind to focus yet. Come on brain wake UP.”

&amp;#x200B;

*I’m so tired.*

Translation: You’ve failed. I’m unhappy with your care of me. I’m always so tired because you’re failing. You don’t balance the responsibilities in our marriage. It feels like I’m doing everything, and you’re doing nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

*I’m the only one pushing the ball downfield.*

Translation: You never help with getting the kids to do chores. What kind of idiot parent are you? At least do this one simple thing. And don’t mess it up.

&amp;#x200B;

WIFE’S UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONVERSATION:

Hi Honey, I’m so glad you’re up. I’m feeling so overwhelmed. I know you’re tired and I wouldn’t normally ask you to do something first thing in the morning. But I want your help! I’m frustrated with our daughter not cleaning her backpack. I just cleaned it. It took so much effort, that it sucked away all my energy. She’s not listening to me on this issue.

Do you agree with this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, my wife and I had the following conversation. I left it feeling insulted. She had no idea she had spoken insultingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actual Statement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wife: I don’t mean to ask you for stuff first thing in the morning. But I need you to talk to our daughter about doing her chores. She’s supposed to clean out her backpack on Fridays. She didn’t do it. She never does it.  I cleaned out her backpack. It was such a big mess. Could you talk to her? I’m so tired. I’m the only one pushing the ball downfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HUSBAND’S UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONVERSATION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is means when translated into the Male Language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t mean to ask you for stuff first thing in the morning. But I need&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Male’s thoughts: I’m just waking up. “Holy cow. I’ve been awake 5 minutes. What are we even talking about?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I need you to talk to our daughter about doing her chores&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translation: This is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Male’s thoughts: “I need to pay attention or I’m going to get in trouble. But I can’t get my mind to focus yet. Come on brain wake UP.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m so tired.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translation: You’ve failed. I’m unhappy with your care of me. I’m always so tired because you’re failing. You don’t balance the responsibilities in our marriage. It feels like I’m doing everything, and you’re doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m the only one pushing the ball downfield.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translation: You never help with getting the kids to do chores. What kind of idiot parent are you? At least do this one simple thing. And don’t mess it up.&lt;/p&gt;

We have a 14 month old and we’re expecting another in February. We just bought a home and since then it seems all we do is argue.

I’ll try and some up out issues that have turned into arguments repeatedly. 

1.) For one I guess I’m starting to resent her about our finances. We are not in a Not much debt (besides house) but my income is modest and she wanted to be a stay at home wife with our first child.

2.)We just bought a home and she is a pack rat. Literally our 2 car garage is full to the brim with mostly her items. I can barely open the door. She has been making attempts.

Our downstairs bedroom is completely full of boxes and she does make an attempt but I think she has a legit hoarding issue. 

3.)Again we just bought a home and I don’t think she understands the responsibility. We have beautiful unfinished hardwood floors and I’m always trying to keep them clean. Our daughter throws her food and it’s already staining the wood. I bought a food Matt to put underneath her chair and my wife refuses to use it. She says it too much work or something. 

4.) I lied to her about smoking e cigs for 6 months. This is my fault i just hid it from her and lied and broke her trust. It’s just hard for me. I haven’t touched an actual cig since we’ve been together I just don’t know how to quit.

,Marriage,"Hi there, all advice welcome. TLDR at the bottom.

  
For a little background, my boyfriend (now fiancé) and I have been together for almost 8 years. We're both 28 and have a great relationship. We're very close, open to each other and have a lot of fun together. We have a great balance between the two of us, have the same values, goals and so on. We've also been through a lot (especially on my side, between high social anxiety, depression, burn out and cancer) but have always worked together on all of it and he's amazingly supportive and loving. There's a bit of imbalance though between the two of us in how we love each other, he's very showing, constantly tells me he loves me, that he finds me beautiful etc, always asks to cuddle etc, while I'm more on the reserved side. Anyways, onto the 'issue'. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks ago, he  proposed. I was a bit shocked and wasn't expecting it at all.   
Even though we had been discussing marriage before, I had just been through a massive surgery (leaving me with no hair and massive scars, so not at my best), plus we were in the process of buying a home, so I definitely had not this in mind, at all. I said yes immediately with no hesitation.   
   
I love him very much and definitely see myself spending the rest of my life with him and having kids with him.  
However, the more I read and hear about other people's stories about their engagement, the more I am getting worried.  


&amp;#x200B;

See, the thing is that I'm very much in love with my fiancé and I'm glad to get married to him, but.. I don't feel as excited as all other engaged people I know and read about. Like our families and friends, even after 3 weeks of engagement keep asking me if I'm still SO excited about the engagement (not the wedding, just the engagement part), if I still have butterflies and so on, if I cried when he asked, if we're having a 'honeymoon phase' now that he just asked, or even here on reddit, I see so many posts about how freaking over excited people are to be engaged, with monthly countdowns to the wedding etc.   


Yes, I was very happy about it, sent pictures of the ring to all my friends and family, and for like a week I was really in this mood. But now, like a month after, while I'm still happy to get married and I'm in love with the wedding planning, I don't feel all giddy and bubbly like everyone else is telling me about.   


&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm seriously wondering: should I be more excited?? Like, is there something wrong? Why am I not as excited as everyone else? It's almost making me second guess everything, like 'does it mean I don't love him as much as I should?', 'am I maybe not that happy about it?' 'why am I second guessing this?' etc.   
I try to rationalise this by the fact that we've been together for 8 years and living together for 7, with cats and very soon our own home, so maybe that's impacting it, as in that getting married is a great step, but it won't change our day to day. And even though we love each other very much, we're not the young 20 years old we were when we met with all the butterflies etc.   


&amp;#x200B;

So, give it to me straight reddit, should I be more excited?   
Is this normal? Any advice?   


Thanks!   


TLDR: My boyfriend of 8 years proposed, I was super happy about it and immediately said yes. Now though after a couple of weeks, I am still glad to marry him and I'm fully in planning mode but I am not over excited/giddy/butterflies in stomach about it, unlike what I see with everyone getting engaged (with countdowns to the wedding, engagement shots, constant posts about it etc).

,Marriage,"My husband (26) and I (29) have been married for 2 years. We got marred 2 years ago so that I can stay in the States. My visa was about to expired at that time so pretty much getting married is what we need to do in order to stay together. We have no wedding, no vows, no honeymoon, and no family and friends there to be our witnesses it was a quick and simple courthouse ceremony. Back then, he’s the one who brought up that we can get married. He made it clear at that time that he doesnt want to marry me but more like he’s doing me a favor so that I don’t have to leave and we can stay together. 

We are now still happily married. In these two years, we had discussions here and there if we should eventually have a wedding and then 2 years passed. Our goals right now is to buy a house and then have kids. Having a wedding can be expensive. However, sometimes when I see my friends being proposed or having a wedding, I feel kinda sad that we don’t have a wedding like all other married couples. Not to mentioned, we don’t have vows, honeymoon, professional pics taken, and family and friends there to celebrate with us. 

I’d say that in general, I think our marriage is at a pretty good state. Both have good relations with one another’s family. We are both devoted to one another. It’s not that I want a wedding so badly as we both agreed our priority is to save for a house. But seeing friends and family be able to go through the proposal, engagement , wedding celebration stages makes me feel like we are missing out something in this life and not sure if there’s anything we can do so that won’t feel missing out so much at all. 

BTW, I think hubby doesn’t care at all. I mentioned to do vows and he’s not very interested. He’s okay with professional pics for our anniversary next year. 

We got married 7/2017. Just this year Feb, we got our rings, it took a long time and many long conversations &amp; fights &amp; convincing to have him agreed to finally get/wear rings. He refused to wear ring for a long time. Back then, he would keep saying that he’s not yet ready and wanted me to stop pressuring him. I was very upset and almost planning to leave him because of this. I’m sad and embarrassed to say that I fought so much to have him agree to get and wear a ring. Sometimes, it still doesn’t wear it as many times he hang out with his single fiends or people. It’s uncool to be married.

I love my husband. However, I think he’s younger and still less mature and doesn’t really know the true meaning of marriage.  Anyone have some advise that I can use ？🙏🏻🙏🏻",t2_3fwlagw2,False,,0,False,Married for 2 years but no wedding,[],r/Marriage,False,6,,0,,False,t3_d14bx2,False,dark,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,self,1568013506.0,,[],[],{},,True,,1567932924.0,text,6,,text,self.Marriage,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband (26) and I (29) have been married for 2 years. We got marred 2 years ago so that I can stay in the States. My visa was about to expired at that time so pretty much getting married is what we need to do in order to stay together. We have no wedding, no vows, no honeymoon, and no family and friends there to be our witnesses it was a quick and simple courthouse ceremony. Back then, he’s the one who brought up that we can get married. He made it clear at that time that he doesnt want to marry me but more like he’s doing me a favor so that I don’t have to leave and we can stay together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now still happily married. In these two years, we had discussions here and there if we should eventually have a wedding and then 2 years passed. Our goals right now is to buy a house and then have kids. Having a wedding can be expensive. However, sometimes when I see my friends being proposed or having a wedding, I feel kinda sad that we don’t have a wedding like all other married couples. Not to mentioned, we don’t have vows, honeymoon, professional pics taken, and family and friends there to celebrate with us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d say that in general, I think our marriage is at a pretty good state. Both have good relations with one another’s family. We are both devoted to one another. It’s not that I want a wedding so badly as we both agreed our priority is to save for a house. But seeing friends and family be able to go through the proposal, engagement , wedding celebration stages makes me feel like we are missing out something in this life and not sure if there’s anything we can do so that won’t feel missing out so much at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, I think hubby doesn’t care at all. I mentioned to do vows and he’s not very interested. He’s okay with professional pics for our anniversary next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got married 7/2017. Just this year Feb, we got our rings, it took a long time and many long conversations &amp;amp; fights &amp;amp; convincing to have him agreed to finally get/wear rings. He refused to wear ring for a long time. Back then, he would keep saying that he’s not yet ready and wanted me to stop pressuring him. I was very upset and almost planning to leave him because of this. I’m sad and embarrassed to say that I fought so much to have him agree to get and wear a ring. Sometimes, it still doesn’t wear it as many times he hang out with his single fiends or people. It’s uncool to be married. I know he loves me, but sometimes, since there’s no proposal/vows, I feel like he maybe doesn’t love me enough to really want to marry me or to ever has the urge that guys normally have when they want to put a ring on their girl and can’t wait to bring this girl home and call her his Mrs. &lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Hello! Apologizing because this is long and looking for opinions from this with advice from experience or wisdom?

My husband and I started dating in highschool. Been married for 8 years. He joined the marines, I followed, went to school. We had a beautiful little girl and a relatively good relationship (for 23 year olds). Right before he got out of the marines and we were about to buy our first home together, he cheated on me with some girl he met on tinder (intentional). She ended things. I had recently lost my oldest brother to Cystic Fibrosis and was in a major funk so I was oblivious to this affair until 3 months ago. Our life since he cheated on me and him getting out of the marines has been filled with PTSD, a lot mood swings, medical marijuana daily usage from him &amp; countless therapy sessions for both of us. It’s also been filled with another baby boy, countless learning experiences and BEAUtiFUl memories. I have learned more about myself and who I am since finding out he cheated on me (3 months ago).
Even with his on and off depression and anger management issues, I love him. Even with him cheating on me. I love him. I LOVE our family. 

The biggest problem is trust. His childhood trauma prevents him from trusting me fully. He tells me multiple times a year he isn’t sure he wants to be with me, has told me he didn’t love me anymore, most recently saying he is having a hard time accepting his decisions to have kids and get married so young and feels he needs to leave us sometimes but he’s going to choose to stay for my daughter who is 6 and loves her dad to pieces (PS. He’s a good father, very good) 
 But I feel he should be staying because he loves me too. Not just my daughter. 
So my trust for him is gone. Even if he came to me saying he wants to keep working on himself and us, I do not believe him. I feel insecure in our relationship as if I’m waiting for him to walk out or question us again. 

I suffer with codependency issues which I’m working greatly on. Me even thinking this much into separating from him is self affirming that I deserve a more concrete love then I have been allowing. 

But I feel so angry because I know I love him. He just doesn’t seem to be in love with me the same way.

,Marriage,"
I was so excited about tonight. Ive been incredible busy with school and work the past few months. My husband came home after a month- long work trip last Saturday. I’ve only really been able to spend Sunday with him because I’ve been either at work or at clinicals (I’m a nurse in a nurse practitioner program). 

Well, earlier this week he told me that he planned a surprise for Friday. 

Today (Friday) he takes me to a lovely restaurant in Annapolis. The plan had been to walk around after but the restaurant was further from downtown than we planned. After the meal, we both agreed that we felt like going home.

I assumed that we would continue spending time together and watch a movie. This is the first evening in a week (and a month before that) that we’ve been able to spend more than a few hours together.

Well, we get home and he asks “do you have homework to to?” This is his way of telling me that he would like to play video games. I tell him, “well I always have readings for school. Do you want to play your video games?” He confirms, but tells me that he won’t play for long. 

I’m disappointed but assume that he’ll come back upstairs to spend some time together shortly.

It’s 10:30P and I realize that it’s bed time (we always go to bed before 11P) and he didn’t leave any time to spend together. 

I get upset. He finally comes upstairs. He notices the look on my face and asks me if I’m tired. I tell him that I’m upset that he played for so long. 

He gets frustrated and walks away. He denies that he told me he wouldn’t play for long. 

I get even more upset because he saw that I’m upset and walked away. He knows that this is a trigger for me and have talked about it multiple times, with promises from him not to walk away from me when I’m upset. 

He then goes to the bedroom to get ready for bed. I take the dogs out and then go to our room to get ready for bed. He’s already laying down on his stomach with his eyes closed.

I leave him there and go to the guest room. I have been sleeping there for the past couple of nights because one of our beds broke. We have two beds in our room because sharing a bed was an issue. 

He realizes that I left the room and asks “are you really that upset?” And I say that I am. 

He gets frustrated. He calls me ungrateful and spiteful. I tell him that I’m not ungrateful full. He says “that’s how I feel... after I  planned an entire evening for us to spend together.” I tell him that that’s all that I wanted.

He asks if I’m coming back into the room. I tell him not after he called me those names. 

He stops responding and turns off the light. 

I’ve been crying for two hours. I cant call myself down. This is the first time that he’s walked away from me upset not once but twice. We’ve never gone to bed upset like this before. And honestly, I won’t be able to sleep tonight. 

It seems that no mater how many times I ask, he won’t be sensitive to my feelings. He just gets frustrated when I get upset and walks away, coming around when he finally decides to make peace. Having him walk away from me when I’m upset is incredibly hurtful. And he knows that. 

I’m so hurt that I don’t know what to do. But I need some outside perspective to understand if I am the unreasonable one.

&lt;p&gt;I assumed that we would continue spending time together and watch a movie. This is the first evening in a week (and a month before that) that we’ve been able to spend more than a few hours together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we get home and he asks “do you have homework to to?” This is his way of telling me that he would like to play video games. I tell him, “well I always have readings for school. Do you want to play your video games?” He confirms, but tells me that he won’t play for long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m disappointed but assume that he’ll come back upstairs to spend some time together shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s 10:30P and I realize that it’s bed time (we always go to bed before 11P) and he didn’t leave any time to spend together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get upset. He finally comes upstairs. He notices the look on my face and asks me if I’m tired. I tell him that I’m upset that he played for so long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gets frustrated and walks away. He denies that he told me he wouldn’t play for long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get even more upset because he saw that I’m upset and walked away. He knows that this is a trigger for me and have talked about it multiple times, with promises from him not to walk away from me when I’m upset. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then goes to the bedroom to get ready for bed. I take the dogs out and then go to our room to get ready for bed. He’s already laying down on his stomach with his eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave him there and go to the guest room. I have been sleeping there for the past couple of nights because one of our beds broke. We have two beds in our room because sharing a bed was an issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He realizes that I left the room and asks “are you really that upset?” And I say that I am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gets frustrated. He calls me ungrateful and spiteful. I tell him that I’m not ungrateful full. He says “that’s how I feel... after I  planned an entire evening for us to spend together.” I tell him that that’s all that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asks if I’m coming back into the room. I tell him not after he called me those names. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stops responding and turns off the light. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been crying for two hours. I cant call myself down. This is the first time that he’s walked away from me upset not once but twice. We’ve never gone to bed upset like this before. And honestly, I won’t be able to sleep tonight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that no mater how many times I ask, he won’t be sensitive to my feelings. He just gets frustrated when I get upset and walks away, coming around when he finally decides to make peace. Having him walk away from me when I’m upset is incredibly hurtful. And he knows that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so hurt that I don’t know what to do. But I need some outside perspective to understand if I am the unreasonable one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to spend an evening together without and distractions. With my school and work responsibilities, we don’t get to spend much quality time together.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"My husband (28M, LL) and I (28F, HL) have been married for 5 years. In the first three or so years of our marriage, he had a porn addiction, unbeknowest to me. During that time, we went a year without sexual intimacy, and later, 6 months without it. It hurts that he’s rejected me so many times when I’ve tried to initiate. He was also going through depression, so I tried to be understanding, knowing firsthand what chronic anxiety is like. 

He didn’t tell me about the porn addiction till about a year ago, and he made it clear that he was no longer masturbating to porn. Somehow it didn’t bother me then, but now it bothers me more than ever- what re-opened the wound was that the other day, he told me he now only allows himself to masturbate when I’m on my period. I started my period a couple days later, which was a daily reminder of what he had said. 

We don’t have sex while I’m on my period, but we rarely have sex when I’m off of it. 

All I can think about at work is how my husband and I aren’t intimate, and whether he’s with me because I make good money. Whether I’m bad at sex. Whether I’m unattractive to him. We have no kids. I often wonder whether I made a mistake in marrying him. But then it doesn’t make sense to divorce over an issue like sexual intimacy. 

He assures me he isn’t cheating, that he’s no longer masturbating (unless I’m on my period-news to me). He’s been going to the gym for 6 months, and he’s been losing lots of weight. I tell him daily how handsome he looks. He doesn’t always return the favor. I’m in the best shape of my life, I work out at least 5 days per week and have never had such a nice body as I do now. 

I want us to have a good marriage and a good sex life, but my self esteem is so damaged from his rejection in the past, that I can’t seem to get myself to initiate. 

And if he initiates, I feel so hurt yet have high libido at the same time. I want to make love, but I’m so hurt that I don’t feel up for it, and so I go to work with high libido day after day.

One thing I’ve consistently reiterated is that after a day of work, I need him to ask me about my day. I’m a teacher and there’s definitely a bleed between my work and life. Furthermore, I’m working toward a degree to be a principal and increasingly there are things I need to talk about that I can’t with people at work.

We talk about my husband’s work daily and he’s had friends from work that we’ve hung out with. 

When I point this out, he skirts around it and tries to play cutesy/sexy and tries to have up make up via sex. 

Since he refuses to apologize or change the behavior, I usually give in because it’s easier. But I’m feeling more and more like he has no interest or value in me.

,Marriage,"Ok, here's my story. It may be long,  we'll see....

I(38m) fell in love with a girl(38f) very early in life (18 yrs ago).   We married when we were 22.  In the beginning things were easy, fun and exciting! We had everything in common and life was good.   We both had our faults but were convinced that we were made for each other,  soul mates if you will.   

She had a hard childhood filled with parental difficulties such as alcoholism, physical/mental abuse, prison time and divorce.   Then step parents with more abuse physical/mental and even sexual.   She was shunned from her family when bringing the sexual abuse to light and moved on her own at an early age.   This led to a rather wild coming of age time for her.   Add all of this to her own diagnoses of clinical depression and anxiety with physical pain (migraines and very difficult menstrual(sp?) cycles.   But still with all of these hardships,  this woman has a heart of gold and forgives and loves the people in  her life very deeply (including the family members who shunned her in those earlier years).  She is a fantastic mother to our children, daughter to her parents and friend/confidant to everyone she meets.   

I had a childhood very different from her.  Mine was very privileged, full of love and support without the messy family difficulties that she dealt with.   My deamons were created with drug and alcohol abuse at a young age and a lack of conscience regarding my choices and how they affected those around me.   

So, we fall in love and marry young.   Like I stated,  things were great in the beginning until I started feeling like me and my family weren't as important as her friends and family.   We had a big blowout after a couple of years of marriage regarding my parents not being allowed to stay at our house when they visit (they're living a thousand miles away) because they made her feel uncomfortable.   I didn't handle it well at all (mature me is able to realise that is most likely due, in part,  to her childhood... hindsight).  I blew up,  told her that was unacceptable and I didn't want to be with anyone who didn't accept my family the same way that I've accepted hers.   I told her I was leaving.   That is the moment she tells me that she's pregnant......I was adopted at birth and couldn't imagine having a child in the world without their father in the picture (my friends and family are all out of state and I wouldn't have stayed inn the same town if I left).

That's where things changed for us.   I did my best to provide and give our little family everything we needed to be happy and healthy doing my best to love my wife and be strong.  This went on for a couple of years until our second was born.  Things were ok.   The marriage wasn't perfect with fights and arguments (nothing ever physical) but it was the bed I made and was doing my best to be positive about everything.   I worked very hard to support us so she could stay home with the kids and raise them.   

Life with someone with manic depression, severe anxiety and things like migraines and fibromyalgia is not easy.   With the kids being young and very dependant, I understood that it was going to be hard and wasn't necessarily about me and my needs anymore.  But, I always hoped in the back of my mind that things would turn around as the kids got older and we began to have more time for us again.   

Unfortunately, things were worse than i knew.   She was feeling neglected and found comfort in the arms of another man.  Note: I need you to know that I was trying.  I would tell her freequently how beautiful she was and that I did love her.  I tried to do my part around the house and carry my weight.   All while working ridiculous hours to make enough on a single income for our needs.   This wasn't enough or not what she needed to feel validated and loved.  I remember feeling that we were growing apart and I noticed her communicating with someone else.   I did confront her about this and was told he was ""just a friend"" and I had ""nothing to worry about"".  

Fast forward a few months.   

I find texts with them referring to each other with pet names and their love for one another.   This was right before we had now been married 10 years.   It was rough. To say the least.  I was a mess.   I cried and raised my voice in anger and was a shell of the man I used to be.   With all that said,  I told her to do what she needed to be happy.   At this point I have so much invested in this family and life, even though it's hard and far from a fairy tale, I would try my best to forgive her if she wanted me to.   I was told that they were, in fact, in love and were true soul mates....i guess there can be more than one?....  I said that she was going to have to make a decision.  Note: if I ever truly wanted out of this marriage, this was my golden ticket....

She decided to stay. 

This situation is even more difficult because I honestly believe that she is only with me because of deep Fear, Obligation and Guilt.  She knows that I can't move back home because I couldn't leave my children.   I'd be alone, with all of my support a thousand miles away.

Im not the same person I used to be.   It's been 7 years and I still think of this moment in our marriage freequently.   I still tell her I love her and she's beautiful and try my best to carry my weight around the house and do special things for her.   The kids are getting older and they're not as dependant as they once were.   All this with the hopes that our marriage would be more focused on us as a couple again.  Unfortunately, my wife's health issues are getting worse.   She's depressed more often and in more pain then she used to be.   Her anxiety is to the point that we don't do date nights at all.   We've tried marriage counseling both before and after the divorce and all of the therapists have said the same thing.   ""You need to do things together,  regular date nights"".  

I'm a very social person and need social interaction to feel alive.   But it's not something I can do with the person I'm sharing my life with.   We don't have guests or friends to the house to hang out or invite for dinner parties.   I'm getting older and understand that ones social life isn't what it was when we were younger, but I see other couples doing it all the time.   This may come off as selfish but I feel like I'm missing out on things important to me due to this bed I've made...? That sounds so weird saying it as I type. 

I feel very responsible for my wife's existence.   Her health and well being depend on me to provide for her.   How could I possibly leave her because her health doesn't allow me to live the life I want to live.....


Wow,  that was too much.   If you made it to the bottom here, thanks.  Tell me what I need to know Reddit.

,Marriage,"I (F) have been struggling in my marriage, just feeling very checked out and over it. So I started seeing a therapist, I’ve had a few sessions and she mentioned our marriage seems to have cracks in the foundation of honesty and trust, which as she described it is the major foundation the relationship needs to be built on. 

Here are a few snippets: 

Had a female friend he was calling with a fake number so it wouldn’t show on our phone bill. While on a work trip he had a male friend meet him in the city to hang out, the night the male friend was there he called the female friend at 1am, then called his male friend at 3:30am. He says he never saw the female friend. That he called the male friend cause they got separated when he went to the bathroom. 

Another night he comes home from a convention at a hotel at 5am. Tells me he ended up in a room party and lost track of time talking to a girl and her sister. 

Couple years later goes to the same convention and comes home after 5am. Had a deleted text message on his phone from the same woman as before. Says he doesn’t know how she got his number. 

There’s more of these weird stories that he always says isn’t him cheating but this nagging voice says there is something more and my trust is destroyed. Add on that I don’t get the affection and attention I’ve asked for and I’m just over it. But, we have kids and I feel I owe it to them to try my hardest. 

Also to add so it’s out there I’m not innocent. About 5 years ago (after story 1 and story 2) I got too close to a male friend at work. Nothing sexual, never found him attractive even but I enjoyed talking to him and did vent about my marriage. This really upset my husband and we did counseling. 

So today I share this with my therapist and she said these are disturbing and not a good way for a spouse to provide a trusting and honest relationship. The words hit me really hard. It is disturbing and to anyone on the outside it really sounds like he’s cheated, although he’s sworn he never did. These things don’t just happen over and over though. 

I’m not sure I have emotional energy to try to rebuild either. It would take so much work and I’m tired. 

I just really needed to get it out. Not sure I really even have a question in it. Just bothered by it. I’m currently reading too good to leave, too bad to stay as well. It gets suggested a lot so wanted to add that.

**edit to add: some of what is bothering me is that I’ve always been this confident woman.

,Marriage,"I am 28 M and my fiancé is 30 F. We have been together almost four years now. We have some common interests like video games and cooking. We have interests that the other doesn’t care too much about; she bowls and likes shopping, I’m a musician and like to go bar hopping. A few months ago we went to Ireland with some family and I proposed to her (maybe sooner than I would have otherwise but I probably wouldn’t get another opportunity like this again). We are both well educated and relatively successful/professional people. We usually communicate well and are in love.

I have a lot of social anxiety in certain situations.

Had a bunch of bad relationships until I met my fiancé. Have been depressed and still am but not due to her. Therapy hasn’t helped much. I struggle to make connections with people that aren’t superficial. Even before my ex I struggled with meaningful friendships, I guess I rub people the wrong way. I have no really good friends. 

Recently she lost her job and picked up some side work, but doesn’t have health insurance. My company has good insurance but she cannot get on the plan unless we are married. Private healthcare is too expensive and she doesn’t want to be uninsured because of past health problems.

,Marriage,"I dont really understand how this whole thing goes but I'm hoping I can get some friendly advice.

So my wife and I, being together 8yrs and married for 2 have always had our issues. Me for not being there emotionally when it was important to her. Her, as I personally feel, disrespecting my thoughts on certain things.

Recently my wife has been hanging out with friends and just reconnected with an old male friend who has had feelings for her for a long time. No big deal right? Well I do feel uncomfortable with it knowing how he has felt. Her reassuring me that he no longer does (without actually asking him) and telling me that I need to trust her. Oh I have always trusted her, but I do admit my insecurities with other men.

So we have been arguing a lot recently and it is understandable if she doesn't like/love me as much. Her friends want to bring her out and have drinks. (Including guy who likes her)
I voice my uncomfortability which upsets her. So I try to bury it down deep. She goes out with them.

First weekend goes well for her. Now comes the second. Goes out again, I drop her off again. Re-meet this guy friend. (Note: I've been having severe anxiety due to all of this). I go home and try to enjoy my night. I have always felt like something was off when they are around each other. Turns out I was right about him. He made a move and kissed my wife that night. Wife was waiting until we were in a good spot to tell me, but I just had this feeling and found out myself. (I am in the wrong for following my feeling and going through her phone. Yes that makes me an asshole and bad husband) She says it was a mistake and will not happen again. She still wants to hang around this person and not lose the friendship.

Days later she can be honest with me and say she enjoyed the kiss because of security and being able to talk about stuff that I had no idea about her. Could they get together at some point? Yes she says, but she doesn't want that to happen.

I do not know what to do or feel because I am in love with my wife and want to trust everything about her. Am I being too hard on myself and her for asking her to get rid of this person. Or am I trying to make myself feel better although I know this may continue?

After we got married we waited 3 years before having our first child so we could get used to being married and plant some roots (got a dog, bought a house, better jobs) which was my husbands idea and I am really glad we waited and did it his way because I wanted him to really want our children. I didn&amp;#39;t want our kids to be accidentals. Our first son was a breeze. Easy freaking baby. Our second son has been the polar opposite of a breeze. But both were planned (we were cocky and got knocked down a peg...) 
Tonight my husband decided to say that I wanted two kids and he didn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely do not know where to go from here. I come from a divorced home and all I ever wanted was for my children to be planned and wanted. He never said he didnt want them close together. It doesn&amp;#39;t even matter what was ever said before because we do have two children now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those things that can never be unsaid. Any tips on how to work through this? I am a pretty forgiving person and I really love my husband he is my best friend. I feel like I may never forgive this but I&amp;#39;m praying I am wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"I was talking with a girl friend today, we’ve been friends since we were 12 and were talking about sex. It came up that she and her husband only have sex once, maybe twice a month. To be honest, I was quite shocked.

**im not saying there is anything wrong with only wanting to having sex on the low frequency side or judging my friend. We all have our preferences and what works for us**

She said maybe once or twice a month, not uncommon for her to realize it’s been 3+ months since they have had sex. She’s okay, and content with this. she says sex isn’t really important to her. Her husband wasn’t there, so I don’t know what he thinks. She says he never complains about it though. Apparently just vanilla PiV, no oral in the last 10+ years.

**again, not judging** 

It just got me thinking. In our marriage, (19 years) sex is still really important to both my husband and I. I’d say less than 3 times a week and i start to get cranky. And oral is *always* on the menu.

I guess it just got me thinking, and wanted an informal poll/discussion because I know we are all different. Just genuinely curious how important it is in the life of others.

Married 20 years, 4 kids. Husband is as good as they come (loyal, devoted to kids, hard-working, all-around good guy). A few days ago, out of the blue, he comes home very intoxicated. This is highly, highly unusual -- maybe 3 times in 20 years together. (He has taken a cab.)

It is a weeknight, and I am irked (don't approve of drinking to that level of intoxication, especially on a weeknight, and especially when he was supposed to be working late.) He is acting very drunk. He tells me to look at his face, and points to a bruise near his eye. He tells me that on his way to get a cab, a panhandler tries to get money from him, and is being very aggressive. Husband says no. Panhandler punches him in the face. Husband tells him to go ahead and try that again. Guy punches him second time. Husband throws guy to the ground, gives him a few punches, cab arrives and husband gets in and comes home.

After hearing this story, I'm very angry. I assume husband provoked the guy because husband is always an a$$hole to panhandlers even when sober, and I'm thinking that he must have been really rude to the guy to get hauled off and punched. I tell husband to ""get the f@#$ out of my bedroom. I don't want to talk to you when you're this drunk."" Husband is offended that I'm ""taking the homeless guy's side."" I tell him I'm disgusted with him, and that I don't want to be around him right now.

Husband is slurring his words and stumbling. He basically grabs me and throws me to the bed. I start freaking out and tell him to get away. He grabs me by the throat and applies pressure. I'm screaming at him to leave me alone. He is saying horrible things, threatening to hurt (and kill) me. Eventually my kids hear the screaming, come upstairs and husband backs off upon seeing them. I'm a wreck. I lock the door and don't talk to husband for the next several days.

Via e-mail, husband claims he doesn't remember anything about this incident (or really anything past the cab ride home.) He tells me he thinks he had a concussion, that he feels beyond horrible, that he'll never drink again, and that he hopes that, with time, I can forgive him but that he'll understand if I can't.

,Marriage,"My husband and I have been married for 4 years. A few weeks ago he told me that since the first month of marriage he's been frustrated with me as a whole. I'm 26 and he's 28. Apparently I'm too emotional for him and I wear my heart on my sleeve too much in front of him. He's not very emotional or affection based and wishes I didn't show him my emotional side. It's now come to the point where he gets mad if I voice any sort of feeling or if something is bothering me. He's very loud, angry and aggressive himself when it comes to showing emotions. I keep apologizing about how I don't mean to exhaust him with my worries. But he's still my husband and I should be able to talk to him.

Is my anxiety in itself an indicator I should not be going through with this?

,Marriage,"Hi All,

This may sound odd but bear with me. 

My husband has a sort of sexsomnia where sometimes during the night he will be super romantic, usually as a prelude to intercourse, and it's honestly like something out of a romance novel, especially when it doesn't even end up in sex because he falls back into deep sleep. 

This lack of inhibition also happens when he drinks, however getting the right level of drunk is difficult and he isn't much of a drinker so I don't exactly want to encourage him to start drinking often.

When he isn't in this state he isn't really romantic and doesn't really know how to be, and it is hard to explain to him and for him to understand  and then follow through on those suggestions.

Is there anything I can really do to bring this out of him? Especially now I am pregnant it makes me feel really unloved that we aren't intimate or romantic with each other.

I know he is capable, but I am not sure how I can get it to come out, or if I even can. It seems all he needs is to have his inhibitions lowered/dropped.

Do I just wait for the odd times it happens?

,Marriage," TL;DR at end

Hello! So my husband and I have been married for about a year and a half and things aren't really going that well. We waited to have sex until our wedding night and I thought that once we got married it would just kind of happen but I was SO WRONG. After a few months of trying unsuccessfully I went to physical therapy and they told me that I had tearing along my vaginal walls from trying to force sex (consensual, we both wanted it soooo badly) and needed probably 8 months of weekly PT as well as working with a dilator at home. Hearing this hurt but I finally felt like there was a light at the end of the tunnel and I was going to be able to be ""fixed"". Well here we are like 10 months later and while things are going much better I still cant tolerate more than 5 minutes or so of vigorous penetration and he's not able to orgasm in that time. I am more than willing to give him all the oral sex he wants/needs but it still breaks my heart that we cant connect like a husband a wife should be able to. At the beginning of our relationship he told me he was addicted to pornography and before the wedding I urged him to go to a therapist to try and get to a root cause of the addiction but he essentially told me that I was trying to change him and he could fix it by himself. Since then he has become even more enslaved to porn but i feel like its my fault since I can't give him the sexual release he needs.

I thought this was the worst it could be but I was apparently wrong. Back in March my husband was in a wedding out of state and I stayed home to work so we could afford for him to go to and stay for two weeks to see his family/childhood friends. But now (6 months later) he told me that while he was there he went to a strip club sober and by himself and got a several hundred dollar lap dance because he thought it would get it all out of his system. He told me he fingered her and performed oral sex on her as well as touched her boobs and kissed her. He said she offered to have sex with him but he declined. My heart is broken. When we were talking about it I bought up the fact that sometimes I wish we had never gotten married because I feel like I'm such a disappointment and he said he sometimes feels the same way and told me about other girls we know who he feels like could push him more than I do. We have a 6 month plan where he's agreed to actually go to therapy, get back involved with our local church and really buckle down on stopping porn but so far (2 weeks in) I haven't seen any change in him and I feel more distant and alone then ever. He doesn't want me to talk to my parents or sister about it because he's ashamed and worried that they'll hate him.

So I guess the advice I'm asking for is: Do I stay? I feel like I'm making both of us miserable. How can I renew my attraction to him? Sex is even harder now because I feel disgusting and ashamed when we're intimate. What can I do to support him beating his porn addiction? How can I better tolerate sex?

I know this is a lot but I just needed to get it off my chest even if that means just screaming it into the void that is the internet.

TL;DR: I have a massive amount of pain during sex. Husband is disappointed that sex isn't like the porn he's seen so he went went and cheated on me with a stripper. What the hell do I do now?",t2_3wesjh8q,False,,0,False,Where do we go from here?,[],r/Marriage,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cz7lhx,False,dark,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,self,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1567558864.0,text,6,,text,self.Marriage,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR at end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello! So my husband and I have been married for about a year and a half and things aren&amp;#39;t really going that well. We waited to have sex until our wedding night and I thought that once we got married it would just kind of happen but I was SO WRONG. After a few months of trying unsuccessfully I went to physical therapy and they told me that I had tearing along my vaginal walls from trying to force sex (consensual, we both wanted it soooo badly) and needed probably 8 months of weekly PT as well as working with a dilator at home. Hearing this hurt but I finally felt like there was a light at the end of the tunnel and I was going to be able to be &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot;. Well here we are like 10 months later and while things are going much better I still cant tolerate more than 5 minutes or so of vigorous penetration and he&amp;#39;s not able to orgasm in that time. I am more than willing to give him all the oral sex he wants/needs but it still breaks my heart that we cant connect like a husband a wife should be able to. At the beginning of our relationship he told me he was addicted to pornography and before the wedding I urged him to go to a therapist to try and get to a root cause of the addiction but he essentially told me that I was trying to change him and he could fix it by himself. Since then he has become even more enslaved to porn but i feel like its my fault since I can&amp;#39;t give him the sexual release he needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this was the worst it could be but I was apparently wrong. Back in March my husband was in a wedding out of state and I stayed home to work so we could afford for him to go to and stay for two weeks to see his family/childhood friends. But now (6 months later) he told me that while he was there he went to a strip club sober and by himself and got a several hundred dollar lap dance because he thought it would get it all out of his system. He told me he fingered her and performed oral sex on her as well as touched her boobs and kissed her. He said she offered to have sex with him but he declined. My heart is broken. When we were talking about it I bought up the fact that sometimes I wish we had never gotten married because I feel like I&amp;#39;m such a disappointment and he said he sometimes feels the same way and told me about other girls we know who he feels like could push him more than I do. We have a 6 month plan where he&amp;#39;s agreed to actually go to therapy, get back involved with our local church and really buckle down on stopping porn but so far (2 weeks in) I haven&amp;#39;t seen any change in him and I feel more distant and alone then ever. He doesn&amp;#39;t want me to talk to my parents or sister about it because he&amp;#39;s ashamed and worried that they&amp;#39;ll hate him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess the advice I&amp;#39;m asking for is: Do I stay? I feel like I&amp;#39;m making both of us miserable. How can I renew my attraction to him? Sex is even harder now because I feel disgusting and ashamed when we&amp;#39;re intimate. What can I do to support him beating his porn addiction? How can I better tolerate sex?&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"We started off as high school sweethearts. We immediately fell in love and I moved in with him. I cheated after the first seven months. I was 18 and I didn’t know if being in a long term relationship was really what I wanted being so young and yet to experience new things. I found a few calls on his phone and it turned out he had cheated as well. We split up and after a month, we decided to get back together. We traveled together, fell deeper in love, spent every single day together, and he even purposed. A few short months later, I got pregnant and had a beautiful baby boy. We both were completely devoted to each other and our new family. It was so perfect. We both even got to attend college. He became an EMT and I started working towards becoming a nurse. Not everything was perfect. I come from an estranged family and his family is way too smothering. There were some difficulties, but they were easy to work through. Anyways, after he got his EMT certificate there weren’t any jobs available in our city, so he had to start working at a job doing hard manual labor to support us so I can finish my degree. It took such a toll on him. His hands were always in pain and he had lost so much weight. He was always tired and sometimes grouchy but I understood. I’d try to massage his hands whenever I remembered to and when I didn’t have homework. We had some pretty bad fights. We both would verbally abuse each other and scream at each other. It was awful. It went on like that for maybe almost a year every month. A few months ago, we both came clean about not being happy anymore. After that, we stopped trying with each other. I cried and begged him to stay and love me a little longer. That once I get my degree, he won’t have to work anymore and can finally rest (which I now realize that was incredibly selfish of me). I wasn’t a good wife to him. I was so jealous and over bearing and I never wanted to give him space. I wanted to fix it right then and there. He was always angry and started the verbal attacks, even when I was crying. He was just so absent. Our sex life was always amazing but it ended up feeling like work. I tried to stay into it but always had to fake an orgasm and wait until he fell asleep to finish. Last week, we finally called it quits. After begging him to love me and stay together, something just snapped and I packed everything and left to my mothers. We decided to switch off with our son every week. I just started nursing school and it’s been so rough. I can’t eat, sleep, or study with out crying. I just can’t act like the past 5 years didn’t happen.

&lt;p&gt;I am 45 years old. Can anyone give me any words of advice or encouragement concerning starting over? Financially I will be okay. My kids are so supportive. But I feel lost and lonely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to lie. I want companionship, please thank companionship that I’ve never had. I want someone I am not afraid of upsetting. Someone who can accept me and my awful taste in music. Is it possible? Has anyone found this in middle age?&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"My spouse (m42) and I (f40) have been married for 9 years (together 12), two kids ages 4 and 8. The state of our house constantly overwhelms me to the point I can't even begin to clean or tidy because I can't mentally comprehend where to start.

Marriage and kids has always been a struggle for me such that i recently started meds and coaching for adhd. I also see a therapist. My struggles mostly include feeling completely overwhelmed, mental exhaustion, tardiness and terrible insomnia. 
The state of the house is a massive trigger for me. My angel of a mother recognizes this and comes over once or twice a month and cleans/tidies the house from top to bottom. When she comes, it's a whole different atmosphere in the house. I feel alive, like I can breathe and enjoy being in my house. But she leaves and within 24 hours, the house is back to being a disaster.

Through therapy and coaching I've learned to make lists and prioritize. I've also hired a professional organizer to help us create organizational systems - everything in our house should have its own place. I constantly purge toys, books, clothes, knick knacks etc. I'm always trying to tidy, put things away, keep on top of laundry and keep our house in a state that makes me feel good and relaxed. 

My husband just either won't or can't get on board with what I need.  He won't follow the systems, only does surface-y things and when he does them, it's to 80%. Example, cleaning the kitchen = does 80% of the dishes, leaves a bunch in the drying rack, doesn't wipe the counters, doesn't wipe the kitchen table. I always have to come in and re-do it or I just live with it like that. Laundry = overfills the washer, turns it on, lets it sit in the machine for 2 days, re-washes everything, puts in dryer, leaves in dryer forever. He also never, ever does the ""bigger"" stuff required for home maintenance. An example: our device to roll up the garden hose recently broke and fell off the wall. Now the garden hose is lying in a (dangerous) pile outside and it will stay in that exact spot until *I* move it or, better, replace the roll-y thing. Never in a million years would I come home to a new garden hose roller installed. And before you jump on me to say ""why don't you just do it yourself?"" I *did* do it myself... i went out, bought a garden hose roller, and asked my step-dad to help me install it. 2 yrs later it's broken and it will never be fixed unless i do it myself, again. 

When i wake up on Saturday mornings, my head is already spinning with how I am going to get my list accomplished in between breaking up sibling fights, coaxing my kids into helping with the house chores, making meals and somehow trying to spend time with the kids/family. My husband has never EVER had a list of what needs to be done around the house. His list is how he is going to spend his free time. If i *ask* him to prepare lunch for the kids (or some other small chore), he's happy to do it... but it's never by his own initiative. If I question why he is outside doing his hobbies before the house work is done, he gets mad and says he deserves a break then lists off all the things he has done (""i got up with the kids, made them breakfast and now I deserve some me time""). Then we get into a tit-for-tat argument of who has done what. Great way to start the wknd.

I've talked to my therapist about how my needs for an organized home are *my* needs and not necessarily my husband's and therefore, these are things I should take care of. An example is our bookshelf is a ""trouble spot""... it collects clutter like dust. So, in therapy we talked about how if *I* need the bookshelf clear of clutter in order to feel good, I need to be the one to clear off the clutter. However, the resentment just grows and grows because I've already established an organizational system where nothing should ever land on the bookshelf... I've already put in the work so that no one should even have to think about putting their shit on the bookshelf. But they do and it's on me to remind them to move it. My husband won't follow the system so i'm constantly drowning trying to get my kids to follow through, trying to get him to follow through and trying to keep on top of everything else. I've begged him to get on board with getting the kids into a routine of tidying their own messes, putting their coats/bags/shoes away, putting their lunches away, washing their food containers but he either can't or won't do it. It's completely exhausting.

Whenever we fight about the house my husband will say he's doing more than enough and proceed to list off the stuff he does.  If i point out that he does these things 80% of the way, he says ""80% is better than zero percent"".

I don't know how to keep my house to the level I need it to be when no one else is willing and/or able to put in more than the bare minimum. I constantly fantasize about leaving and getting my own condo/ house where I can control what comes in, what goes out, what goes where and having the mental energy to teach my kids to pick up after themselves. 

People say ""you don't get divorced because of dishes""... but, maybe you actually do?

,Marriage,"Here’s a story of what just happened, still baffled and confused.

Backstory: we have had our ups and downs, are in marriage counseling, and looking to find ways to communicate better and work on our relationship. She speaks fluent English but there is plenty of times there is miscommunication and she thinks I mean something else when I really don’t at all. We got married because we were are in love but also so she can finally work in the USA and live here for good (what she wants) . We have been married for 9 months together for a year in total . I got her a car in my name on my credit, got all the immigration paperwork to get started to become a citizen and got married once we got serious which is quick. She moved in with me from another city which my rent is significantly cheaper and more room and a nice place to be honest. 

Here’s some of the things we disagree on and also just is what she does but doesn’t feel that it needs to be fair. 

She thinks that we shouldn’t do anything without each other, even if it’s a guys trip or anything. I understand it’s a marriage and spending time with each other and living our lives together is important and I agree but I also think it’s healthy to do hobbies with friends etc. nothing that would cause harm in a relationship. She disagrees. 

Time: she is always late and by late I mean anywhere from 20 minutes to 3 hours. Even when it’s planned. But when she wants to do something expects that I stop whatever I’m doing to go do it with her.

Coming home: we live with roommates, we have the master bedroom, she expects me to be waiting for her to come home and be excited( which I am) , to not be doing anything else or stop immediately for the rest of the night when she gets back from work or whatever it is. I personally have no problem spending time with her when she gets home but if I have 20 minutes left of a movie or whatever it is. I don’t feel it’s a problem if I say hi, give her a kiss and finish what ever it is and dedicate the rest of my night to her. I don’t believe I am doing anything wrong here. I even will chat for a while but I think I should be able to finish what I am doing.

The story:
Just a couple of days ago we were great we went camping had a great couple of days life was good talking non stop having fun communicating, my friend rick owns a boat and my friend ted called me out of the blue saying want to go fishing tomorrow on ricks boat. I said sure I’d love to, then he had to get off the phone before we could talk more said he would call me back he had to talk to rick. So I text the wife saying going fishing tomorrow :)! Not expecting anything wrong from it. She said I want to go I said let me ask and see. (She has work this day I already knew so I didn’t think she would want to go) also we went on my parents boat and she said she hates boats and that was on a lake. We were going to the ocean! Well boy was I wrong, it started off with me asking ted which he replied it can’t fit anymore then 4 people which he was bringing his gf later to find out that boat holds more but he just wanted to have less people on the boat to fish and told me no when I asked if my wife could come. I told her they said only 4 people can go let me talk to rick. Which I did and rick said sure that’s no problem just let her know it’s going to be a rough day on the ocean and that’s why my wife isn’t coming. I then told my wife hey come, can you get off work. 

This is when things all went down hill. I was told I didn’t care about her or even ask for her to go and that my friends were assholes for not inviting her from the beginning, that they did not want her there. Which is not true. not to mention she has only met rick once for 15 minutes and never met ted who owns the boat. I work quite a bit these past two years and haven’t had time to do anything with anyone except my wife these past months. My friends called me out of the blue and wanted to go. She told me that she no longer wanted to go on the trip and I shouldn’t go either if she doesn’t go. She can go but refused to go. Later that day gave me a ultimatum saying if I went that would be the end of us. I replied with let’s go it will be fun my friends barely know you they didn’t not invite you for other then they don’t really know you at all or know if you as we barely speak! 

Clearly I went on the fishing trip tried to get her to go and told her to take off work which she said she could do. She refused it all, because I didn’t ask her before telling her I was going. 

So I went fishing and as I was going I was told if I go out on that boat it would be the end of us. Today she went looking for houses to move to, her place of work is shutting down and she is doing Uber, with the car I have in my name and helped her get. 

I think
 1. This shouldn’t be a reason for divorce. 
2. She is being unreasonable and controlling. 
3. Is this someone that actually wants to be with me? 

Feel free to light a fire under my ass if I am wrong cause I’d really like to understand, but also want to know if I am just being a moron and being used?

Hello all,

My husband (30m) and I (24f) have been married nearly 3 years and together nearly 6. Within the past couple of years, i have found myself not feeling attracted him. I brought this to his attention maybe a week ago, he got defensive and basically started asking why he wasnt good enough and why dont I want to have sex with him? 
I assured him he IS good enough and I cant pinpoint why I dont want to have sex with him beyond me not finding myself sexually attracted to him. 
I think hes attractive, but the thought of us having sex does NOTHING for me, and in fact, does the opposite. There have been quite a few times where during sex, or right after, I start crying because it triggers me from past sexual abuse. 
He comforts me and always stops when I ask him to, for the record. 
I'm really stuck and not sure what to do. I'm 24, I want to have sex. And I'd like to want to have sex with someone I'm supposed to spend my life with.

Husband has told me things about her, work related, some not, never anything alarming. A few weeks ago I noticed K uses lots of heart eye emojis and crap in their texts, and I asked him about it. I asked him very directly, if I have anything to worry about. He said no. Ok. 

This past Sunday, based off of things he has told me, I told him it sounds like K has feelings for him. He said he agrees. He then tells me how she has crossed boundaries multiple times, to the point that he has told her it’s wrong. She has said things like “if you didn’t have H, you don’t even know what I’d do to you”. 
He feels he can’t do more than he has, or it will jeopardize his job. 

This has been going on for months. And it was hidden. Kept from me. We agreed before moving in together that things like this would be aired. We would let the other know of someone crossing boundaries or being inappropriate with us, if an ex were to contact us, etc. I am hurt. I feel betrayed. Lied to. He thinks he did nothing wrong.

Am I taking it too personal? Was he wrong? I fear I can’t trust him in the future.

,Marriage,"Hi everyone,

I'll get straight to the point. I've been married 5 going on 6 years now to my husband who I love dearly. We moved out of our home state, California, three years ago for me to pursue my PhD. So far, thing have been great and we are both doing well in our careers/schooling. Here's where the potential problem comes in. Recently, my husband spoke to his sister and she is trying to move out to out city. We live clear across the country on the east coast so this wouldn't be a short or convenient move. I found it odd that she wanted to move out here without even having see the city, but that's her choice. Today, I spoke to my husband's father and his wife. They just told me that they are looking to move out here to our exact city too. Also without having seen it or knowing anything about it. While speaking to his sister today, I asked her what about her brother and his family? Were they also thinking of moving out here too? I asked kind of jokingly. She said most likely after a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I'm worried about. We have a tiny two bedroom house we just bought that's probably \~900sq ft. While I love his family dearly, I'm worried about a few things. Everyone in the family, his sister, his brother, and dad have kids. With his dad, all his kids are grown and he is the stepfather to his wife's daughter. In the past, they all decided to stay with us at once. This was total chaos. I'm worried about this happening again. I'm in the third year of my PhD and am currently working over 40 hours a week and my husband also works full time. I've been having trouble dealing with anxiety, work life balance, and possibly depression throughout graduate school. Having a quiet place to come back to whether it's to keep working or relax has been crucial for my mental health. I'm terrified of losing that now.  I wouldn't be worried if this hadn't already happened before.

I know family is important though. I have no problem helping his sister out if she needed to stay for a bit because she has her stuff together and would work hard toward finding a place out here. However, the brother is a different story. He's believes that being family gives him the right to live with other family members without contributing to bills, cleaning, or helping out in any way. He also has two kids. His dad is also welcome to stay if he needs it. However, his wife has caused a lot of drama and problems in the past. The rest of his family is very wary of her. His dad's physical and mental health were suffering at one point because she was mentally abusive to him.

I guess I don't know what I'm asking here. I know my husband and I need to be on the same page about all of this before anyone moves out here. I want to set some boundaries. I'm not sure how to bring this up to him. My husband is very stubborn yet non-confrontational. Last time there were problems between his brother and I when he decided to live with us for months without even asking, we had a big fight. His brother and I have some awkward tension between us now. I'm right in the middle of my PhD and I've been working for 10 years to get to this point. I won't be able to get work done if our small house is full and there are little kids running around. My husband and I have chosen not to have kids because our careers keep us too busy. We also don't want to have kids. How do I bring all this up to my husband without it sounding like I'm telling him to choose between me and his family? I'm definitely not asking that! I don't care if they come over to visit. I just can't have people here everyday when I need to work or have a quiet place to recollect myself in.

,Marriage,"After 4 years of a rollercoaster marriage, I took the first step towards divorce.  We almost divorced once before.  We came close.  But I still had hope in him and in us.  I begged him to stay with me, that I would change all of my shortcomings and actively change and work to fix all the issues he had with me.  I also needed him to do the same with his issues.

Even though I had made mind boggling changes with everything he needed me to change about myself, he was treating me worse and worse.  

&amp;#x200B;

He would call me names, scream at me, points out everything I was doing and explain how ""wrong"" it was.  He belittled my decisions, and 24/7 he had this attitude towards me like as if I was his worst enemy.  Most of what he talked about was negative and brought me down.  He would call me names in front of the kids.  My grandpa died last week and on the day he died, my husband flipped out on me.  He was bullying me and in front of the kids!  Things finally came to a head last night after my grandpas funeral.  He was heartless and woke me up after I fell asleep from sheer exhaustion to put our daughter to sleep.  Things escalated and he said fuck you to me and went upstairs and started throwing things around and stomping all over.  This scared my girls and we locked ourselves in the basement bedroom and cried.  Both of my girls said they were scared of him.  I was scared of him.  I was locked in fear, but in the past when I have called the police on him he has gotten very angry so I feared calling them for what he might do.

Today I went and petitioned for a restraining order and temporary custody and they awarded it to me.  When he found out I was doing that, he went and did the \*same thing\* and was denied.  He called me before the papers were served and he said the only reason I got the restraining order was because I used ""strong"" words like \*Abuse\*.... what he has been doing IS abuse I told him.  He didn't think so.  Then he said it was awarded to me because I was a woman.  

&amp;#x200B;

He got his things from the house and the police made sure he left.  I feel like I can exhale now.  I feel a great weight lifted, but at the same time I am scared of what he might do.   Up next is the divorce, and I have been in contact with the local Rape and Abuse crisis center to help walk me through this.  

  
For years I dealt with his abuse.

,Marriage,"I don't even know where to start. Spouse \[32M\] and I \[27F\] have been married 4 years. Together, we have a 2-year old. Our relationship has been through a lot. He has a child from a previous marriage, so that alone has added a bit of complexity to our marriage. However, the last 2 years have been a complete rollercoaster. Things get bad (but I tell myself it isn't *that* bad because I know others have it way worse) and then things can be great.

TLDR; I am just so. damn. exhausted. Too often, I find myself scrolling the r/Divorce page. Thinking out the details of finances, custody, where I would live. I honestly believe that if I knew I could support myself and my child without my spouse's help, I would be gone. I hate to call it ""emotional abuse"" but really, how much longer am I going to allow him to walk all over me? I'm not really looking for advice, I guess. Venting mostly. I know we need individual and couples therapy bad.

**Helpful things to know:**

We both work full-time jobs. We have limited familial help for childcare related issues or even emotional support. These combined have added some hardship.

**Trust.** A few months after our child was born, he deployed. Long story short, I found out that he was making mildly inappropriate comments to another woman deployed with him. We got through it but my trust in him took a big hit. More recently, I discovered that he was 'liking' NSFW booty pictures of girls that we actually know, as well as the random Instagram 'model'. I know, these things are minuscule and bordering petty. But they're a piece of this messy puzzle.

**Work, Money, Moving.** Since he deployed and returned home, he fell into a job that put him working extensively outside of the 9-5. He was later faced with making a decision to take a decent government job out of state. This position requires a very high amount of travel. *Reminder: we now live out of state, away from the limited family we already had.* We (I) had to sell our house in our home state, which we took a loss on because we had only owned that home for 3 years. This entity did not pay any relo, so moving expenses were on us. I had to find a new job in this new state and have ended up at a reputable organization in the area, but it's basically a non-profit and pay is complicated. It's also incredibly stressful. But my new position offers an unexpected perk of having flexibility and time off to care for our child. I have thrown around the idea of finding new employment, but the flexibility hinders me and I have been learning A LOT and gaining some really good experience. He tells me I should go back into the military, when I literally can't (as much as I want to) because of his job and our child needing at least one parent with a stable schedule.

Anyway, now I'm being hard-pressed to get back on the hunt because he wants me to make more money. He has complained about every single job I've had (this is my third) since we have been together. He travels and then comes home nagging, degrading and belittling my work, my income, my parenting, my housework. ""Stop closing the washer door"" and nags about why it should be left open for the next 10 minutes. My Master's degree and student loan debt are worthless because I don't bring home $100K.

My boyfriend and I have been together 3 years (living together for 2) and tentatively want to get married next summer. The thing is, he’ll be going to PA school fairly quickly after that. The benefits are that he can be on my work’s health insurance instead of paying out of pocket, my job will take our relationship more seriously if I decide to move out of state to follow, and I can change my last name before I’m super established in my industry. The cons are that he would lose a lot of financial aid due to my relatively high income. We could potentially save $30,000 by putting it off 3 years.

Some other factors are that I’ll be trying to buy investment properties during this time, so I’m curious if student debt will hurt that.

,Marriage,"My apologies in advance if this has been posted before. My wife and I've been together for 14 years, married for nearly 8.  We have two healthy, happy kids (ages 1 and 4). For most of our time being married, my wife's never been much of a kisser, but she's made me happy in so many other ways that I think I just let it go (I know, my fault). There are times when we have had intense kissing which has been hot, but it's few and far between....probably once a year.

But lately, it's bugging me more.  I've told her and she acknowledges that it is weird. She'll give me a peck on the lips and if I try to take it further than that, she says ""I don't want my face eaten.""  Soo, I dialed it back to accommodate her (not open my mouth as much), but that didn't work either.

Is she not attracted me anymore?

I don't think it's a physical appearance issue. As a matter of fact, I've lost nearly 20 lbs. since last December (I'm 6'2"" 181 lbs.).  I work out 6 days a week. She complemented me recently on seeing my abs actually.  She knows girls check me out from time to time, but I don't mention it because I don't see the point and she'll just get mad anyway.

Is it a hygiene/health issue?

I asked her this and she said no. I shave every day for work, but also floss and brush my teeth. I don't smoke or dip and don't have any medical issues in my mouth. My skin/lips are fine.

Am I bad kisser?

It's possible since she made the ""face eaten"" comment, but I had girlfriends in the past and kissing was never an issue. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed it a lot. I must say there's a photo from around the time we first met though, and it's her pulling back from me during a kiss, so I honestly think this might be the answer, but let me know your thoughts. Tonight she told me ""I don't know...it just weirds me out.""

What's in her upbringing that could explain this?

She was never close with her Dad at all. I mean, he was physically in the house, but emotionally he was unavailable.  Her Mom basically raised her and her siblings by herself.  He brought home the bacon and that was that. I've mulled this one over before and think there might be some merit to it.  Maybe she has some intimacy issues?

Any health issues of hers?

She does have a built-in retainer, which I honestly didn't know those had to be worn for life.  Do they?  I think that might be part of her hang-up too. Aside from that, she's gained weight after having kids and always struggled to exercise. She eats pretty healthy though, and I've resigned myself to the fact that we must pay for a trainer for her, but she only works out once a week with the trainer and then once at home on her own if I'm lucky. I used to nag her, but gave up when she told me to stop.

Is she cheating on me?

I doubt it. She works part-time from home and only goes into work once every 2 weeks. We leave both our computers open to each other and there's nothing in her history that would indicate anything remotely alarming to me. Her main focus is planning a family trip later this year and between that, work, occasionally working out and pumping milk for our youngest daughter, there simply isn't time for an affair.

Does she not respect me anymore?

Maybe, but why would that happen?  We started giving each other massages and talking each night a few months ago. It's been great. Not in hopes of sex -- but because it feels nice after a long day and we actually talk to each other once the kids are in bed. I have a great job and make good money. She's acknowledged it before and respects that I am able to provide for our family. I help out with the kids too -- feedings, changing, playing with them. I encourage her to take time out with her friends if she needs to (she usually doesn't, but is finally planning something in a month or two). One thing I stink at is being more handy around the house, but that is fixable of course).

After some common fights we've had each year, I also made immediate changes to prevent them from happening again.  I know I'm not perfect, but I really try hard to listen to her and meet her needs.  When I asked her why she thinks she doesn't like to kiss, she shrugged and said ""I don't know. I think it's just me.""  And the more I ask about it, she tells me I'm annoying her and to stop asking her, even though I told her it's because I'm her husband and I love her.

&lt;p&gt;After some common fights we&amp;#39;ve had each year, I also made immediate changes to prevent them from happening again.  I know I&amp;#39;m not perfect, but I really try hard to listen to her and meet her needs.  When I asked her why she thinks she doesn&amp;#39;t like to kiss, she shrugged and said &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. I think it&amp;#39;s just me.&amp;quot;  And the more I ask about it, she tells me I&amp;#39;m annoying her and to stop asking her, even though I told her it&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;m her husband and I love her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I missing here?? HELP!!&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Hi, I am reaching out to see what you think about this new info I received.

I am in a committed marriage for the past 15 years. I am turning 40 very soon. I am married to a very hot woman that daily strives to be a better wife, mother, coworker, and person.

Last night, we were sitting in bed naked, as we do routinely, facing each other and talking . The conversation turned to a book I am listening to from a comedian that was relaying her only experience having a one night stand. For giggles, I asked her if she had ever had a one night stand.  I thought the answer would be a quick ""No"", because she told me she only had sex with a boyfriend many years before our time together. However, she took a minute to think about it and said no I don't think so, then after a few more moments of thought she said a definite “No”.

I thought that was strange, so after a bit I asked her “why that took so long to think about, I thought you only had sex with your previous boyfriend?” She has always been very evasive about her past relationships, therefore I always thought there was more. So, she admitted that there were 5 other sexual partners before me.  I, on the other hand, did not have sex with anyone else before her.

She said that she sometimes feels bad about having so many past sexual experiences while I have not had any variety.  Then she announces rather abruptly that she would like to give me a ‘hall pass’.  I heard that and was astonished.  I asked her Why, but she didn’t give much detail.  All she asked was that if I did do anything, please don’t tell her.  She is a very jealous type.  I told her that would be hard for me to use the ‘hall pass’ and not tell her that I did, because she would either see the charges on the credit card, or see that I got to bed extremely later than normal, or see that I am staying ‘later at work these days’.  Either way, I wouldn’t want to use the ‘hall pass’ and keep that from her.  She said, please don’t tell her.

Later, still reeling from hearing that she had many past sexual partners, I asked her point blank, “I don’t want to offend when I ask you this, but have you had a sexual partner while we’ve been married?”  To which, she answered that it took her 15 years to answer the sexual partner question, and that she will tell me the answer to that question in another 15.

So, what should I think about this conversation?

Should I be concerned about past sexual partners, possibly within our marriage?  How much info about past sexual partners is too much within a marriage?  Should I wait 15 more years for the answer to that question?

Why is she offering a ‘hall pass’?  Should I use the ‘hall pass’?  If so?  For paid sex, one night stand sex, or side fling?  If not, why not?

,Marriage,"My wife (37F) and I (38m) are highschool sweethearts and have been together for 22 years married 13.  Over the years there have been red flag instances where I should of called it quits because to the way she chooses to deal with conflict, but I have stuck it out until now. I'm not sure if I should end things or try to work things out because of our kids. The backstory is that her mother and father fought a lot growing up and she had to deal with emotional abuse from her mother for years after her parents divorced. She has yet to deal with issues from her childhood in counseling even-though I've suggested many times and even our marriage counselor suggested she should. 

Fast-forward to this morning and today's incident. Everyday it's my job to wake our youngest and get him ready for school, most morning this can be challenging because he never wants to go to school and hates waking up(typical kid stuff). Usually I'm playful but today we were running late and rushing to make school bus, as usual he was moving slow and doing everything but getting ready for school. My wife choose to interject from another room because she didn't like tone I was using while dealing with my sons insolence. As she barked orders to my son from another room, I told her that I have situation handled as a way to let her know to butt-out and she was not helping speed things along. She then enters the room and starts into a tirade of disrespect all pointed at me saying things like, you are short, not shit, called me stupid, several different types for MF's and I should die because of my highblood pressure. Then she hit me in the back of my head and challenged me to fight saying she could take me and she wish i would hit her. During this tirade i stayed cool and told her calm down and go back in the other room. While this is only one of many situations over the years they all pretty much start and end the same way. 

While my youngest son seemed completely oblivious by this situation my oldest was in his room listening and worried things would go from bad to worse; which they didn't. After school today he called me something he never does just wanting to talk. He said he was confused because he doesn't understand why mom would get so angry and say such hurtful things over something so small. He thinks tirade was unwarranted and absolutely crazy. He's worried and doesn't know what to do.  I told him not to worry and his confusion is normal because what he witnessed was not. At this point I'm concerned that situations like this may skew his understanding of normal and healthy relationships.

,Marriage,"My wife and I have tried this relationship meeting concept for about 3 years. Yeah I know people hate meetings of just about any kind. In just about any organization, meetings can be helpful for communication.

We do this because we don't typically fight fair. We realize that we both have suffered trauma from past relationships and or childhood. We might not have dealt with the traumas fully or even know they exist. As you know hurt people hurt people. To help mitigate these issues we would have a meeting about every six weeks or so to discuss how we feel in the relationship and address any issues we may have.

How do we do this? We set the meeting during a relaxing time with no distractions, like an early Sunday morning. It is mandatory to lay in the bed NAKED. That's right NAKED. There's something about being naked next to one another. There's something about a leg or an arm touching makes us more open and objective.  We can talk about anything that has to do with our relationship. We have never fought in this meeting. It has always given me a better perspective on how she feels. It also feels good to be heard.

I bring this up because we have not stuck to our meeting times for whatever reason or excuses. This past weekend we had an argument and things were said that were not helpful to our relationship. We have since made up and realized the issues in the argument stemmed from poor communication and lack of information.

,Marriage,"Posting this clearly on a throwaway account here. I’ve been lurking this sub for quite a while and really appreciate the the advice that people give out here, and I haven’t spoken to friends and family about any of my issues so this seemed like the best place to get opinions. 

Backstory my wife and I have been married for two years and have a beautiful 1 year one child. In the beginning everything was amazing, but ever since maybe a few months after our child was born, things have been really different. I’m the only one working in the house, so she is a stay at home mom who also is trying to finish up her degree. Here are the issues that I keep having with my wife, and it’s really starting to weigh me down. 

1. Negative, my wife has become someone who seeks the worst possible outcome for everything. Every little step she takes towards being positive and productive has to begin with me talking her into things, getting her excited, or her committing to something (I then try to motivate by following up on said activity) which leads to an argument. 

2. Control. My wife absolutely needs to control everything now. She doesn’t like me looking or even talking about females in any way that would show any attention to them. I thought it was funny at first but now, it’s really annoying. Anytime I bring it up, it becomes a big deal and a disagreement occurs. 

3.  Communication. My wife has never been one to fully communicate her issues, but fuck. It’s gotten so bad. She’ll like stomp around the house or complain, then when I try to sit down and talk to her, she’ll refuse to talk. Which in turn leads me lose my mind and start to raise my voice (it always stretches out at least 3 hours for her to finally say something), and then she’ll attack me for how I talk to her, and then apologize after our argument and promises she’ll work on her communication. It’s been happening every month. 

Now those are the major complaints I have in my marriage. I’ve thought about us splitting but with a child, I would hate to do that. I just don’t know anymore. I’m tired of apologies that don’t do anything. It’s hard enough income wise to make enough for 3 people, but I just feel like I’m on the verge of letting go. Any advice would be amazing.",,False,,0,False,Typical Marriage Issues?,[],r/Marriage,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cwtk5u,False,dark,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,self,False,,[],,{},,True,,1567068188.0,text,6,,,self.Marriage,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posting this clearly on a throwaway account here. I’ve been lurking this sub for quite a while and really appreciate the the advice that people give out here, and I haven’t spoken to friends and family about any of my issues so this seemed like the best place to get opinions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backstory my wife and I have been married for two years and have a beautiful 1 year one child. In the beginning everything was amazing, but ever since maybe a few months after our child was born, things have been really different. I’m the only one working in the house, so she is a stay at home mom who also is trying to finish up her degree. Here are the issues that I keep having with my wife, and it’s really starting to weigh me down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative, my wife has become someone who seeks the worst possible outcome for everything. Every little step she takes towards being positive and productive has to begin with me talking her into things, getting her excited, or her committing to something (I then try to motivate by following up on said activity) which leads to an argument. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Control. My wife absolutely needs to control everything now. She doesn’t like me looking or even talking about females in any way that would show any attention to them. I thought it was funny at first but now, it’s really annoying. Anytime I bring it up, it becomes a big deal and a disagreement occurs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication. My wife has never been one to fully communicate her issues, but fuck. It’s gotten so bad. She’ll like stomp around the house or complain, then when I try to sit down and talk to her, she’ll refuse to talk. Which in turn leads me lose my mind and start to raise my voice (it always stretches out at least 3 hours for her to finally say something), and then she’ll attack me for how I talk to her, and then apologize after our argument and promises she’ll work on her communication. It’s been happening every month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now those are the major complaints I have in my marriage. I’ve thought about us splitting but with a child, I would hate to do that. I just don’t know anymore. I’m tired of apologies that don’t do anything. It’s hard enough income wise to make enough for 3 people, but I just feel like I’m on the verge of letting go. Any advice would be amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Hi everyone, first post here. I (M37) have been married to my wife (F34) for the last 16 years. We've both had our ups and downs when it comes to weight and unhappiness with our physical appearance but she much more than I. 

I am in a place where most people would consider me physically fit and muscular (I am 6' 2 215# @15% body fat). She however is the biggest she ever has been (as she puts it).

She feels extremely ashamed, scared, and resentful of my physical shape I feel. She also has commented on the attention I've gotten from other females and how it makes her feel. Even though I would never cheat or even indulge in flirting with another woman, I have to admit it is nice to be hit on once in a while. 

I have tried everything i can to give my wife assurance and try to ease her anxiety when she says ridiculous things like ""you could be with anyone else why would you want to stay with me?"" But to no avail. I really can't understand why she would say things like that after 16 years of marriage it's almost insulting. 

Recently, I have started to try and be more romantic. 3 weeks ago I started to say the phrase ""You are beautiful"" in a different language every single day (thank God for Google translate) and it HAS helped I feel, she smiles so big everytime I do it.

We have always cuddled on the couch every night watching TV until bedtime but recently I've started trying to make her ""feel"" smaller by the way I hold her and she has even said she likes how little she feels in my arms.

I write her love letters (old school ink on paper, boys. It works better than texting.) I reassure her how attracted I am to her physically and sexually but still she is super insecure about her body. We have 3 kids.

,Marriage,"Growing up sex was not talked about. No sex education,  No mother-daughter talk. In fact, nothing female was explained including my period, until after I had started.So of course I thought God was punishing me for masterbating and hid my underwear.

Then growing up there was genital shaming and jokes about oysters and fish. 

The vibe I got from the women in my family was that sex was a duty much like a chore. Didn't want to but had to as part of the marriage package.

I guess between the above and Church indoctrination I should have been what was called a ""dead fuck"" then. But somehow I came away with a sex in marriage is good view and figured it out on my own.

So appologies for the scheduled sex fiasco post. It seems that people are scheduling sex due to life stresses, kids, and work. I too felt myself at one time falling into a set schedule.

And this is what I should have said, but didn't and I'm really sorry about that. You see I was never allowed to express my views growing up. Just had to fall in line. So I'm rather ungracful and blunt because I've had such little practice.

My marriage went to another level of intimacy when I opened up more sexually to my husband and he to me. In fact, I can fuck at the drop of a hat but it took me years to make love. And once I incorporated making love the sex become more open and raw. I hid me behind fucking and fucking was my barrier to intimacy.

But, when sex went from just fucking for need and lust to an expression of love manifested, it somehow changed my view of the importance of sexual activity, all of it not just intercourse. It was like communion. Our private time in which we shared our soul and body. 

It was this realization that led to a more unstructured routine which caused me to grow closer to my husband. If the basis for marriage is love, then why not be open to more sexual activity I thought. For me, it turned out that the more sexual intimacy we had the more I desired it. Our sexlife deepened when we chose to offer up our bodies to one another without a set pattern or day.

The above is not to be confused with sex on demand. It's not. 

Sex was fun, it was healing, it was nourishing. No longer did I leap to the bathroom to drop his semen. It was part of the communion between man and wife.

,Marriage,"Hello,

I'm going to make this as quick as possible and would really appreciate the advice of married folks on here.

I've been with my wife for 6 years and married for 3. We had instant chemistry and I could see her becoming my wife. She has great values and is an all around great person which is why I married her. A year before we got married, I got a condition that completely destroyed our sex life for many months. She didn't leave and supported me until things got better which I appreciated. Neither of us has family in the US so we are 100% alone.

Eventually I noticed that she's a very emotional thinker. When she wants something, she doesn't consider the circumstances (whether we can afford it, timing...) and would throw a fit about it until she gets what she wants. I had the conversation with her that it is a problem and wouldn't be sustainable since making decisions in such way could destroy our lives. I on the other hand am very calculated when it comes to making decisions. She acted that way about getting married when we were obviously not financially ready. Thankfully things got better and we finally got married, no big expensive wedding. I felt rushed but it wasn't bad.

After we got married, she started putting on weight. Her friends told her that she was gaining weight and that she needs to look after herself. I had also told her before we got married that I told her that I take care of myself and want her to do so. I was even personally going to the gym with her and cooking healthy meals for her. She eventually told me I'm controlling and that I should let her be.

Communication problems started rising because what I say would always be taken as what she wants to hear or doesn't care. For example, before the marriage, I sat down with her and showed her all our finances, went over the debts and everything, just to find out months later that she didn't even know how much I make and doesn't even remember us talking about finances which made me realize that she wasn't even listening.

Right after marriage she wanted a baby and would cry when I'd mention anything related to having a baby. We weren't ready to have one since she was in the process of getting her degree and I was financially supporting her 100% while she goes to school (She needed to take a few years of school so that she can convert her French law degree and be able to work in the US as a lawyer). I had spoken to her regarding not having a baby until she's settled with her career and we're financially ready. Given that she may do things without thinking much about it, I had also told her that no matter what happens, she shouldn't even think about trapping me and she cried when I said that and said that she'd never do such a thing. Unfortunately, she did get pregnant. The pregnancy completely messed me up because now I had to think about all the financial issues ahead. Her pregnancy was very bad so she had to quit school and was constantly sick. I was by her side through the process but emotionally I wasn't as I was very stressed. We had debt, hospital bills, student loans... and our sex life died. We almost didn't have sex during the pregnancy mainly because I just wasn't sexually attracted to the fact that she was pregnant and was constantly vomiting. Luckily she doesn't gain pregnancy weight and had the same weight as she did before the pregnancy so her weight gain was due to a poor lifestyle. After the birth, she stayed home to take care of the baby.

At this point I had lost my attraction to her though I still love her and want to make things work. Even though I never said anything, she could feel like I wasn't into the sex the way I used to be. I would have a hard time getting aroused and lost interest in sex with her though I would still try my best. She brought it up and I told her it's just the stress. Eventually I told her that I lost attraction and she told me that I don't love her anymore and if I really did love her I would be attracted to her no matter what. She had stretch marks and her breasts became saggy which I told her I didn't care about and that doesn't bother me at all. It's just the weight that I have an issue with. After I told her, while she was overseas visiting family, not in a mean way or putting her down, she decided that it's better if we get a divorce and said that she's staying at her mom's. She then blocked me and avoided talking to me for 2 days. Eventually I spoke to her and told her she got my support in her weight loss journey and I am here to work on things with her the way she worked through things with me when I had my condition. She told me that I am deflecting and that I am in denial about my sexual issues which have been fixed but she's convinced herself that somehow I have a sexual disorder that I don't want to admit. She also told me that she has no intention of changing her diet or losing weight and if I can't be attracted to her the way she is I should simply just get a divorce. When I had my condition, she told me that it makes her not want to have sex with me and despite the fact that it did hurt that she said that, I understood and I worked things out. On top of all that, she blames me for not being able to finish school and start her career which I do not believe is my fault.

I really don't want a divorce but I am willing to go through it if needed. I have been very unhappy for the last 2 years and so has she. She said that gaining weight shouldn't deprive her of happiness and that she deserves a husband who always is attracted to her no matter what and I also do deserve to have a wife that I am attracted to. I cannot be in a position where I have to think about another woman to get aroused when I am with my wife. Communication issues have piled up to the point where I don't even want to have to discuss serious things concerning our couple because if it's not what she wants to hear it turns into her getting upset. I do not trust her anymore after the baby trap despite the fact that I love our child to death.

I would be great to hear your takes on this and I am looking forward to enlightening responses.

Communication issues have piled up to the point where I don&amp;#39;t even want to have to discuss serious things concerning our couple because if it&amp;#39;s not what she wants to hear it turns into her getting upset. I do not trust her anymore after the baby trap despite the fact that I love our child to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be great to hear your takes on this and I am looking forward to enlightening responses.&lt;/p&gt;

,Marriage,"Hi everyone.

My wife and I got married back in June, and since then I’ve been struggling to wear my wedding ring a fair bit of the time due to comfort.

As a guy I’ve never worn jewellery before, especially rings, so it’s very new territory for me.  I’ve been wearing it as much as possibly both at home and out, but most days I find I need to take it off for a few hours to stretch my hand a bit. It’s never uncomfortable due to tightness and always slips off with a little bit of resistance, it’s just the presence of something on my hand.

I was hoping after a few months I’d be used to wearing it for much longer now, but I’m hoping someone here might have some secret sage advice or clever trick to make it more comfortable to wear? Or do I just have to let my brain figure it out on it’s own?

It’s an 8mm tungsten carbide ring if that helps at all.

,Marriage,"Looking for some advice for dealing with a pathological liar. We are married for 6 years with two small children. 

My wife is a pretty big drinker. She drink 1-2 times a week. But when she does, she goes all out and drinks until the wee hours most of the time.

We had some issues early in the marriage. I caught her texting two of her ex boyfriends. There was also one time where we were fighting and I found her drinking at bars with her friends, talking to guys. We addressed it and moved on. But I continued to be suspicious about her honesty. I trusted her, but was cautious. I had also caught her in a few other lies but nothing that was serious. She is also very frisky when intoxicated. She makes bad decisions when shes drunk. She has a DUI. 

Two weeks ago i caught her lying about money. She opened up a new credit card, put hundreds of dollars on it, buying clothes and items for herself. I found the clothes in her car and asked about them. She said "" i dont have to tell you everything, its none of your business"". If she had asked to buy things I would have been fine with it. I don't care about the money ( well a little) What i care about is the dishonesty.

My wife has been working a new job and for the first time, she is making more money than me. The job requires trips to other cities pretty often. 

We talked out the lying about clothes and she left for her trip. She called me in the early evening and said she was going to dinner. She called me later that right around 10:30pm. She said she was taking her sleep meds and was going to bed. 

I didn't buy it. Call it stalking or whatever- but I was going with my gut feelings here and needed to know. now. I tracked her iphone to a bar around midnight. I continued tracking until 2am until I fell asleep. The next morning I got a text from her around 9AM saying she didn't feel good.

I didn't say anything at first. But a few days later when she got back in town I asked about her trip.

I asked where she went to dinner. She gets confused and says uh uh uh uh uh I didn't go to dinner. She admits she went to a bar with a bunch of male coworkers. I asked why she lied and she accused me of being jealous that I was ""too stupid to do her job."" We have barely spoken since.

Of course I would never get concrete proof she slept with someone. But if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck... During previous arguments, she has stated that ""if i did cheat on you, i wouldn't tell you"". 

I am not a possessive husband. But I am not OK with my wife drinking with men at bars late at night. I don't think most husbands are. Girls nights are whatever.

Even if she didn't cheat, the #1 thing in a relationship, honesty, is broken.She has a few more ""trips"" coming up soon and the same thing will happen. Drinking at bars with men. 

Need some advice on what my next course of action is. I want a divorce but I also don't want to be away from kids half the time.

,Marriage,"How did you approach it? Did it ever become an ultimatum? Looking for advice please. 

Let me start by saying, I (F, 30) love my husband (33), I’m in love with him, and he’s my best friend. We click. I want to be married to his complicated, sweet ass forever and always. I couldn't imagine life without him. 

My DH is an amazing guy. He’s incredibly sweet, boisterous, fun, and is the type to make friends wherever we go. However, he also has unchecked depression, ADD, OCD, and addiction issues. He’s had the misfortune of having quite a few people in life pass away, including his best friend. He also comes from a culture that doesn’t give credence to mental health, so his emotions usually go unacknowledged by his parents and siblings. He has an alcohol dependency problem. He says it’s because he has no other way to unwind when he comes home in the evening. This is the only way he manages stress. 

I’ve brought up therapy, but it just never happens. The times I bring it up, he accuses me of nagging him about it. He’s not opposed to it. In fact, he pushed me to get therapy early on in our relationship. I trusted his advice and now, years of therapy of medication later, I feel good. Now, I wish I could do the same for him. We have great health insurance and we live a really comfortable life. He could see a therapist once a week if he wanted to. Sometimes, I just bring him to my therapist during “couples counseling” and let him talk to her. She’s facilitated many conversation between us and has told him that its time for him to seek his own therapist so he can get individualized therapy. He'll nod and agree with her, then blow it off as soon as we head home.  

I’ve stopped trying to have the “therapy” conversation with him because he gets defensive. So now I check in with him in the evenings, and a simple, “hey, how are you feeling? I just wanted to ask because you seem really quiet/sad/stressed lately” turns into an argument and I get shut out. Try as I might to remind him that he’s not alone and that I’m here to help and we have the resources, he just won’t acknowledge how bad it is for him, and now our marriage.

,Marriage,"Some of the women in my life complain when their SO is sick. They call it ""man-cold"" or ""man-flu"". They complain that their husband is being ""dramatic"". 

I recently had the flu. It was the longest illness of my life. 9 straight days of fever, headache, and horrible muscle pain. My husband handled it like a CHAMP. He was on top of my medication regimen, making sure I got Ibuprofen every 8 hours and acetimetiphen every 4 hours. He made a giant stockpot of chicken noodle soup. He was my hero every day.

... Which is why it makes me so sad to hear women complaining about taking care of their sick husbands. Why are men not taken seriously when they are sick? Is it because they are not allowed to show even the tiniest amount of vulnerability? If you don't know what I'm talking about, just Google ""man flu"" and you'll find a ton of articles on this.

Today I got a job interview and chatted via Zoom so he heard me talking (but not the interviewer) the entire time, we live in a studio apartment.

Then later dinner we talked about the interview and he pointed out that I forgot to mention something that I should have said. I told him and I did but he insisted that I didn't because he didn't hear it.

I said I did and got annoyed because I was trying to explain on how the interview went and he'd cut me mid sentence telling me that i didn't do something I should've done. I straight up told him that this behaviour of him talking to me that way is annoying and I find it rude. I find it inappropriate that he would not let me finish my sentence. He already knew long ago that I do not like it but he still does anyway lmao.

He resolved it by saying he is not going to ask me anymore about my job interviews.
